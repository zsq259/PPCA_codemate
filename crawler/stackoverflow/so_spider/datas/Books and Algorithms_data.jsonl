{"Question": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' RecognitionOne of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.Some constraints on the project:\nThe background could be very noisy.\nThe can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).\nThe image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).\nThere could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!\nThe brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely \"too much\" on color detection).\nThe can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.\nThere could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.\nSo you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:Language: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.Pre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:\nChanging color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on \"red\" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n  \nNoise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.\nUsing Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n\nAlgorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:\nYou can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).\nIt is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.\nIt uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will \"learn\".\nEach pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.\nIn the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...Results: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:\nIt is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.\nIt was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)\nFuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.\nIn-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.\nCan you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)", "Answer": "An alternative approach would be to extract features (keypoints) using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) or Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF).```\nYou can find a nice OpenCV code example in Java, C++, and Python on this page: Features2D + Homography to find a known object```\nBoth algorithms are invariant to scaling and rotation. Since they work with features, you can also handle occlusion (as long as enough keypoints are visible).Image source: tutorial exampleThe processing takes a few hundred ms for SIFT, SURF is bit faster, but it not suitable for real-time applications. ORB uses FAST which is weaker regarding rotation invariance.The original papers\nSURF: Speeded Up Robust Features\nDistinctive Image Features\nfrom Scale-Invariant Keypoints\nORB: an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF\n", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

If I learn from one of these, I would like to choose a programming language to code and run the algorithms in.  Then, there are other books which introduce DS & A concepts with examples written in a particular programming laguage - and I would like to code these algorithms as well - thus, to a certain extent, the language picks the book too.Either way, I have to pick a language, and I would prefer to stick to one throughout. Setting aside personal language preferences, which one is best for this purpose?", "Answer": "The answer to this question depends on exactly what you want to learn.Python and RubyHigh-level languages like Python and Ruby are often suggested because they are high level and the syntax is quite readable. However, these languages all have abstractions for the common data structures. There's nothing stopping you implementing your own versions as a learning exercise but you may find that you're building high-level data structures on top of other high-level data structures, which isn't necessarily useful.Also, Ruby and Python are dynamically-typed languages. This can be good but it can also be confusing for the beginner and it can be harder (initially) to catch errors since they typically won't be apparent until runtime.CC is at the other extreme. It's good if you want to learn really low-level details like how the memory is managed but memory management is suddenly an important consideration, as in, correct usage of malloc()/free(). That can be distracting. Also, C isn't object-oriented. That's not a bad thing but simply worth noting.C++C++ has been mentioned. As I said in the comment, I think this is a terrible choice. C++ is hideously complicated even in simple usage and has a ridiculous amount of \"gotchas\". Also, C++ has no common base class. This is important because data structures like hash tables rely on there being a common base class. You could implement a version for a nominal base class but it's a little less useful.JavaJava has also been mentioned. Many people like to hate Java and it's true that the language is extremely verbose and lacking in some of the more modern language features (eg closures) but none of that really matters. Java is statically typed and has garbage collection. This means the Java compiler will catch many errors that dynamically typed languages won't (until runtime) and there's no dealing with segmentation faults (which isn't to say you can't leak memory in Java; obviously you can). I think Java is a fine choice.C#C# the language is like a more modern version of Java. Like Java, it is a managed (garbage collected) intermediate compiled language that runs on a virtual machine. Every other language listed here apart from C/C++ also run on a virtual machine but Python, Ruby, etc are interpreted directly rather than compiled to bytecode.C# has the same pros and cons as Java, basically.Haskell (etc)Lastly, you have functional languages: Haskell, OCaml, Scheme/Lisp, Clojure, F#, etc. These think about all problems in a very different way and are worth learning at some point but again it comes down to what you want to learn: functional programming or data structures? I'd stick to learning one thing at a time rather than confusing the issue. If you do learn a functional language at some point (which I would recommend), Haskell is a safe and fine choice.My AdvicePick Java or C#. Both have free, excellent IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ Community Edition for Java, Visual Studio Express for C#, Visual studio community edition) that make writing and running code a snap. If you use no native data structure more complex than an array and any object you yourself write you'll learn basically the same thing as you would in C/C++ but without having to actually manage memory.Let me explain: an extensible hash table needs to be resized if sufficient elements are added. In any implementation that will mean doing something like doubling the size of the backing data structure (typically an array) and copying in the existing elements. The implementation is basically the same in all imperative languages but in C/C++ you have to deal with segmentation faults when you don't allocate or deallocate something correctly.Python or Ruby (it doesn't really matter which) would be my next choice (and very close to the other two) just because the dynamic typing could be problematic at first.", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Questions regarding code in a Data Structures and Algorithms bookI have been refreshing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms using a book. I came across some sample code in the book, including some run time analysis values that I cannot seem to make sense of. I don't know if I am overthinking this or I am missing something extremely simple. Please help me out.```\n\nThis is the case where they explain the logic behind adding an element at a specific index in a list. I get the logic, it is pretty simple. Move all the elements, starting with the rightmost one, one index to the right to make space for the element at the index. The code for this in the book is given by:\n\nfor j in range(self._n, k, −1): \n    self._A[j] = self._A[j−1]\n\nWhat I do not get is the range of the loop. Technically, self._n is equivalent to len(list) (an internal state maintained by the list). And if you start at len(list), you are immediately at an IndexOutOfBoundError. Secondly, even if that were not true, the loop replaces n with n-1. Nowhere does it actually move n to n+1 first, so that value is lost. Am I missing something here?  I actually tried these conditions out on the Python interpreter and they seem to validate my understanding.\nSome of the run time analyses for list operations seems to confuse me. For example:\ndata.index(value) --> O(k+1)\nvalue in data --> O(k+1)\ndata1 == data2 (similarly !=, <, <=, >, >=) --> O(k+1)\ndata[j:k] --> O(k−j+1)\n\nI do not get why the +1 at the end of each running time analysis. Let us consider the data.index(value) operation, which basically returns the first index at which a certain value is found. At the worst case, it should iterate through all n elements of the list, but if not, if the search finds something at index k, then it returns from there. Why the O(k+1) there? The same logic applies to the other cases too, especially the list slicing. When you slice a list, isn't it just O(k-j)? On the contrary, the actual indices are j to k-1. \n```\nThis understanding should be quite elementary and I really feel silly not being able to understand it. Or I don't know if there are genuine errata in the book and I understand it correctly. Could someone please clarify this for me? Help is much appreciated.", "Answer": "Note (from the comments): the book in question is Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser, and the questions are about pages 202 to 204.```\nIf you actually look at the whole definition of insert from the book, it makes more sense.```\n```\ndef insert(self, k, value):\n    if self.n == self.capacity:\n        self.resize(2 * self.capacity)\n\n    for j in range(self.n, k, −1):\n        self.A[j] = self.A[j−1]\n\n    self.A[k] = value\n    self.n += 1\n```\n```\nThe first line implies that self.n is the number of elements, and corresponds to the index past-the-end, which means that, for a user of the list, accessing it at that index would be erroneous. But this code belongs to the list, and because it has a capacity in addition to a size, it can use self.A[n] if self.n < self.capacity (which is true when the for loop starts).```\n```\nThe loop simply moves the last element (at index n-1) to the next space in memory, which is out of bounds for a user, but not internaly. At the end, n is incremented to reflect the new size, and n-1 becomes the index of that \"next space in memory\", which now contains the last element.```\n```\nAs for the time complexity of the different operations: well, they are not incorrect. Even though O(n+1) = O(n), you can still write O(n+1) if you want to, and it might be more \"precise\" in some cases.```\n```\nFor example, it is written that data.index(value) has a complexity of O(k+1), with k the index of the value being search for. Well, if that value is at the very beginning, then k = 0 and the complexity is O(0+1) = O(1). And it's true: if you always search for a value that you know is at the very beginning, even though this operation is pointless, it has a constant time complexity. If you initially wrote O(k) instead, then you would get O(0) for that last operation, which I have never seen used, but would make me think that the operation is instantaneous.```\n```\nThe same thing happens for slicing: they probably wrote O(k−j+1) because if you only take one element, then j = k and the complexity is O(1) instead of O(0).```\n```\nNote that time complexity isn't usually defined in terms of the actual indices of a particular application of the function, but instead in terms of the total number of elements in the container on which the function is used. You can think of it as the mean complexity for using the function with every possible index, which in the cases of index and slicing, is simply O(n).```\n", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Algorithm to assign library books to members such that maximum members are satisfiedI was given a problem in a class test. In a library, each member requested for four books and each book was requested by only two members. This information is given in the form of bipartite graph G = ( X + Y , E )X : Set of all members\nY : Set of all books\nEdge E = set of edges (x,y) where x is a member requested for book y.\nWe have to find the way librarian can give maximum two books to each member such that maximum members are satisfied.I came out with two approaches:\nIntroduce two new vertices s(source) and t(destination). Introduce edges from s to all members in X with capacity 2. All edges E has capacity 1 and new edges Y to t has capacity 1. Now apply Max flow algorithm to find maximum matching. The maximum matching is the required solution.\nThe other way is to follow same algorithm as above by introducing same edges but the capacity of each edge is 1. Now find maximum matching. This matching will give one book to maximum members. Remove the matched books and again apply above algorithm. Again remove the matched books and the members who have got two books and again apply algorithm until no edge between X and Y remain. The achieved solution is the required solution.\nAlthough I got above algorithm but I am not sure which is correct or none is correct. If there is any other algorithm then please suggest here.", "Answer": "the first one seems correct. with the second one, you have no guarantee that your first round book assignments will not prevent you from reaching the optimum.", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Can I add a new header in a circular doubly linked list?I just had a assessment about data structures and algorithms. And my teacher said that it is impossible to add a new node before the header. I have checked everywhere (on the internet and books) and it all said that is was possible.So now my question is, who is right here?EDIT: Here is a picture of the situation, add the red arrow I need to insert a new node. ", "Answer": "You can add a first element easily (in one step) even either to the usual linked list or double-linked one. You are right.\nThe new element will get the pointer to the old first element. \nFor double-linked list also the old first element gets back reference to the new element.  \nThe new element becomes the first one and is addressed as the list.\nBut be very soft and careful telling the teacher about his/her mistake. Maybe: \"you meant inserting the last element in one step for the non-circular doubly linked list really, didn't you?\" :-) I hope, you teacher is not the kind of person that gets easily offended hearing complex sentences.As for the circular doubly linked list, you can insert both last or first element in one step. For the insert at head:\nA new element gets reference to the old first and the back reference to the last ( from the old head back reference)\nOld first changes its back reference to the new first\nLast changes its reference to the new first.\nHead (if you have one as a special something that has not data and is not a node) changes the reference to the new first. Edit According to your picture, you have not such thing. \nYou can also insert any element into any list, but it could take many steps moving from one element to another, for to reach the place.Edit \nMaybe, your teacher really meant that special reference that references the circular list from outside and has not its own data. It can exist for some special need. The very question of putting something into the list before the header has not sense at all - for the header does not belong to that part of the structure where the word before is defined. The element that is before the first element, is not outside the list, but it is the last element of the list. That header, of course, can have something referencing it. The header is merely a reference, and it can have another \"header of the header\" and so on. ```\nBig fleas have little fleas,\nUpon their backs to bite 'em,\nAnd little fleas have lesser fleas,\nand so, ad infinitum.\n```\nAnd only an act of human will or some technical or religious limitation can forbide the possibility to reference a reference.So, if the question (how to put something before the header) has sense, the word \"before\" for header must be interpreted as \"referencing to\", and we can put something before it. If \"before\" is defined for list nodes only, the question itself is senseless.", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "How do you approach solving data structures and algorithms problems?I have been having trouble finding the best solutions to data structures and algorithms questions issued by interviewers.

Is it a matter of just practicing solving all kinds of problems to get the experience, or do you guys have systematic ways to recognize certain types of problems? Can you recommend books that could help me? I've reread a lot of Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS, and I'm sure I could refresh on fundamental CS concepts.I have developed some common sense in recognizing types of problems. E.g. if I am able to recognize that solutions to later iterations of a problem depend on past solutions, and ultimately stem from known base solutions, I know this is a dynamic programming problem. Maybe I need to study more to further develop this common sense.Thanks for reading.", "Answer": "I'm not sure SO is a best place for this question, but I recommend you \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.Classical books about algorithms are ok, but they focused on more fundamental and \"academic\" stuff.

I just wonder what is the best way to learn data structures and algorithms, especially for the \"reading fundamentals\" phase. I'm not sure if it is efficient if I try to memorize the code in books before turning to problems.", "Answer": "Don't just memorise code; that won't get you very far. Instead, understand it. (If you are finding that hard, find a better resource.) Why does it do that?Data structures are always something I've always found make intuitive sense, and that's because I saw through the code. A 1D list? One thing after another. 2D list? A list of numbers, and several lists at the positions indicated by the numbers (like the Table of Contents in a book). A linked list? A sort of conga line, where each item is holding onto the next (but they're probably not in an orderly row). Look at each data structure you come across, and work out what it looks like and what it's for.Algorithms are a bit trickier. Let's take merge sort as an example. It splits a list roughly in half, sorts each sub-list, then merges them back together by taking the smallest number from the top of each pile. Because they're sorted, the top of each pile is guaranteed to be smaller than the rest of the pile, so the smallest number out of the tops of the two piles is guaranteed to be the smallest overall and so the next item in the correctly sorted list.Since merge sort sorts lists, you can use it as its own \"sort each sub-list\" function. In order to stop that carrying on forever, though, it needs to check for a 1-long list at the beginning and return that list, since that's already sorted and it would carry on forever if it split that, sorted it by splitting it and sorting it by splitting ...There. Merge sort described in the way that I store it in my head. You'll see no code there, and that's because in different situations I'd implement it differently. In C code for a low-RAM system I might make it sort a list pretty much in-place by alternating between two copies of the list, with only an O(n) heap and O(log n) stack requirement. I might even use a clever algorithm to remove the requirement for a stack to store indexes. In Python I might implement it with generators, so that it yields successive items of the sorted list. And so on.If you understand the algorithms and data structures, it'll be a lot easier to learn them. So try to work out what they mean and what they do.```\ndef merge_sort(l):\n    if len(l) == 1:\n        yield l[0]\n        return  # Stop infinite recursion\n    pivot = len(l) // 2  # Roughly in the middle (integer division)\n    pile_a = merge_sort(l[:pivot])  # Sort the first half of l\n    pile_b = merge_sort(l[pivot:])  # Sort the second half\n    del l  # We don't need it any more; this allows the computer\n           # to reclaim some memory if sorting a massive list\n    a = next(pile_a)  # The first items of pile_a and pile_b\n    b = next(pile_b)\n    while True:\n        if a < b:\n            yield a\n            try:\n                a = next(pile_a)  # Get the next item\n            except StopIteration:  # pile_a is empty!\n                yield b            # Yield the top of pile_b\n                yield from pile_b  # and the rest of it too\n                return  # Exit the function\n        else:\n            yield b\n            try:\n                b = next(pile_b)\n            except StopIteration:\n                yield a\n                yield from pile_a\n                return\n\nfor x in merge_sort([4, 7, 23, 6, 2, -52, 3, 654, 1, 45, 2, 3, 3, 6]):\n    print(x)\n```\n", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

I've been programming for 4 years in Java, Python, C and C++; I've been a decent programmer. Now, I want to move beyond learning programming languages and start learning algorithms.I tried 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Cormen et al. but the Math is too dense for me (or, may be, I'm too dense for the Math in that book).Now, I'm planning to take up Algorithm Design Manual by Steve Skiena. Would you recommend it for my situation? Do you have any other recommendations if you think this is not the one for me?", "Answer": "I would certainly recommend the Skiena book.  You've started to learn about algorithms, you should start to learn algorithms too.To whoever edited this answer and replaced the last occurrence of the word algorithms with the word mathematics: I meant algorithms when I wrote this answer, I still mean algorithms, replacing the word with mathematics materially changes the answer.  If you think that mathematics is what OP should learn, post your own answer to that effect.  If you had troubled to read the commentary below you would understand why I chose the word algorithms and not mathematics.", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "what is the right time complexity of this functionI'm a beginner in data structure and algorithms. I have come across this problem in a book (Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy In Java) and the complexity is given as O(√n) in the book. To my understanding, it looks the function grows more than O(√n) but less than O(n) with the input.```\npublic void function (int n) {\n   int i=1, s=1;\n   // s is increasing not at rate 1 but i\n   while( s <= n) {\n      i++;\n      s= s+i;\n      System.out.println(“*\");\n   }\n}\n```\nCan you please explain what is the correct time complexity of this function?", "Answer": "```\nThe book is correct. Each time, one is added to i and i is added to s. Hence, s will be 1 and 1 + 2, 1 + 2‌ + 3, ..., 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k. Now, k is the number of running loop and the complexity is Theta(k) or O(k). Now to find the value of k, we need to solve 1 + 2 + ... + k = n. As 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2, we will have k*(k+1)/2 = n. Hence, k = Theta(sqrt(n)) (just solve the equation), and it means the algorithm is in O(sqrt(n)).```\n", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

It introduces DSP concepts like sampling, as well as simple filtering implementations, without relying just on math for explanation.  Cookbook equivalent: You know how to boil water on a stove, but you're nervous about the rest.A more advanced book, more of a practitioner's handbook than a text, is \"Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing\" by Lawrence Rabiner and Bernard Gold.  Their explanation of the overlap-save FFT technique for convolution, in particular, is the best I've ever come across.  Cookbook equivalent: Maybe Joy of Cooking, maybe the Cordon Bleu tome.And \"Telecommunications Breakdown\" by Richard Johnson and William Sethares is great for taking some DSP concepts and bringing them to life by implementing a radio in software. Cookbook equivalent: A tour through a specific cuisine, and explains what \"braising\" is along the way.Hope these are of use to you!", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Any Data Structures & Algorithms books w/ examples in Objective-C or other Keyword Message Language?I've tried searching for Data Structure / Algorithms books that provide examples in either Objective-C, or another language supporting keyword message syntax, to no avail. The reason I'm interested in this is because I really think the keyword syntax would help me understand the intent of code, which I find I have to think longer about in languages with typical function call syntax.A good example is this snippet from a SplayTree implementation in C:```\n/* Continue down the tree.  */\nn = splay_tree_splay_helper (sp, key, next, node, parent);\n```\nThe function name is pretty unhelpful, and even with the comment I have to thoroughly read the code to have any idea what's really happening there.I know that technically any piece of C code is valid Objective-C, but I'm looking for something that structures algorithm implementations utilizing a good object model like Objective-C's since I believe the resulting code is more maintainable. This may seem counter-intuitive in the performance restricted space of algorithm design, but I've seen plenty of Algorithms books that have examples in idiomatic Ruby, Python, Javascript etc.Basically I'm looking for anything with a good object model that allows for very descriptive keyword messages, whether it's Objective-C or even (though probably unlikely) anything else in the Smalltalk family.", "Answer": "Why would you want a book? Just download a smalltalk environment and read the whole actual source.

If you make this change, the code should work. The compiler won't convert pointers to const types to regular pointers, because that would break the constness. ```\nAlso, on line 82 ad 83, the textbook writes:```\nint i; // Error: i never initialized\nfor (int i = 0; isalnum(ch); i++) { // process this term:\n```\n```\nIt looks like it was trying to use i both inside and outside the for loop, but the author accidentally declared i a second time at the start of the loop. We can fix it by doing this:```\n```\nint i = 0; // This is probably what was intended\nfor(; isalnum(ch); i++) { // process this term:\n```\nWhy can't I modify string literals?Imagine if you could do ```\n5 = 10; // This is complete and utter nonsense. \n```\nThis doesn't make any sense! You can't assign 5 to 10. In the same way, this is also nonsense:```\n\"hello\" = \"blarg\"; // This is also nonsense\n```\n```\n\"hello\" is always \"hello\", and never anything else. If the compiler allowed you to write```\n```\n\"hello\"[0] = 'H'; // This is also nonsense\n```\n```\nThis would be modifying \"hello\", which could just... break your program. It's wrong; it's evil. In fact, the string literal \"hello\" might even be placed in a section of memory that's flagged as const by the Operating System itself. ```\nWhy does the compiler give you the error (or warning)```\nIf you have char*, that is a pointer to a char. If you have const char*, that is a pointer to a const char. If you could go from const char* to char*, this would allow you to modify const memory, which could break the program:```\n```\n// If you could do this, you could modify \"hello\"\n// Modifying \"hello\" is nonsense, so this should be nonsense too:\nchar* s = \"hello\"; \ns[0] = 'H'; // How you'd modify \"hello\"\n```\n```\nAs a result, string literals can only be assigned to const char*:```\n```\n// Because s contains const chars, elements of s can't be modified so this is fine\nconst char* s = \"hello\"; // This is OK\n```\nWhy did the textbook contain the error?The language used to let people do really unsafe stuff, like modifying string literals. This is extremely bad practice and it breaks optimizations the compiler uses to make programs smaller and faster. The textbook is probably written by someone who's used to writing old, unsafe code.

{"Question": "Explanation of a function definition in logic gate code in Problems in Data Structures and Algorithms(I am new to Python and OOP so please let me know if I use nonsensical language at any point.)The book Problems in Data Structures and Algorithms implements code for binary and unary logic gates in a hierarchical fashion. Please see the bottom of my question for the full relevant code.My particular query is: in the Connector class, in the constructor, there is the line```\ntgate.setNextPin(self)\n```\nReferring back to the unary gate where the setNextPin function is defined:```\ndef setNextPin(self,source):\n    if self.pin == None:\n        self.pin = source\n    else:\n        print(\"Cannot Connect: NO EMPTY PINS on this gate\")\n```\nThe \"source\" in the function setNextPin is the input of the function setNextPin. So when I see the line tgate.setNextPin(self),  it tells me to go back to the unary class (tgate) to find the function setNextPin, and that the input (\"source\") of the setNextPin function is self, which in this case is an instance of the Connector class. However, I don't really see how this makes sense. I don't see how a connector class could be the input for the variable \"source\" in setNextPin. The full code:```\nclass LogicGate:\n\n    def __init__(self,n):\n        self.name = n\n        self.output = None\n\n    def getName(self):\n        return self.name\n\n    def getOutput(self):\n        self.output = self.performGateLogic()\n        return self.output\n\nclass UnaryGate(LogicGate):\n\n    def __init__(self,n):\n        LogicGate.__init__(self,n)\n\n        self.pin = None\n\n    def getPin(self):\n        if self.pin == None:\n            return int(input(\"Enter Pin input for gate \"+self.getName()+\"-->\"))\n        else:\n            return self.pin.getFrom().getOutput()\n\n    def setNextPin(self,source):\n        if self.pin == None:\n            self.pin = source\n        else:\n            print(\"Cannot Connect: NO EMPTY PINS on this gate\")\n\n\nclass NotGate(UnaryGate):\n\n    def __init__(self,n):\n        UnaryGate.__init__(self,n)\n\n    def performGateLogic(self):\n        if self.getPin():\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return 1\n\n\nclass Connector:\n\n    def __init__(self, fgate, tgate):\n        self.fromgate = fgate\n        self.togate = tgate\n\n        tgate.setNextPin(self)\n\n    def getFrom(self):\n        return self.fromgate\n\n    def getTo(self):\n        return self.togate\n```\n", "Answer": "```\nThe Connector class represents the wires that are used to connect logic gates to each other. setNextPin() is given a Connector, and associates this with the pin property. When it wants to get the logic gate that provides its input, it calls self.pin.getFrom(), which goes to the Connector getFrom() method, which then returns the Connector's fromgate property, which will be the gate at the other end of the wire.```\n", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "How does this delete an element from an array?I am using this book data structures and algorithms in java to learn about (you guessed it) - data structures and algorithms. This piece of code confuses me. I have tested it and it works but i don't see where in the code we specify to delete 55 exactly?I see that we search for it in the array and move data elements up the index but don't see where we tell the compiler to delete 55.```\n    searchKey = 55; // delete item with key 55\n    for(j=0; j<nElems; j++) // look for it\n      if(arr[j] == searchKey)\n        break;\n    for(int k=j; k<nElems-1; k++) // move higher ones down\n      arr[k] = arr[k+1];\n    nElems--; // decrement size\n```\n", "Answer": "To be precise, this code does not delete an array element; it overrides it.```\nNote how j is declared outside the first loop, and used in the second loop to initialize the value of k. The first loop walks j through the array, until j \"points\" to the element with the value of 55. When this happens, the code exits the loop through break, so when the second loop reads j, it still points to the location in the array where 55 is stored. Now the second loop copies elements from k+1-st location into k-th, \"overriding\" the value of 55 on the first iteration, and then moving the rest of the values in the consecutive iterations.```\nConsider this example:```\nIndex:  0  1  2  3  4  5\nValue: 30 40 55 60 70 80\n```\n```\nAfter the first loop j is set to 2. Each iteration of the second loop changes the array as follows:```\n```\nIndex:        0  1  2  3  4  5\nIteration 0: 30 40 55 60 70 80\nIteration 1: 30 40 60 60 70 80\nIteration 2: 30 40 60 70 70 80\nIteration 3: 30 40 60 70 80 80\n```\n```\nAt this point nElems is decremented, making sure that the last element (i.e. 80) is disregarded if the program runs again.```\n", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Why this is a bad bubble sort algorithm?I started studying Data Structures and algorithms, and tried to implement Bubble sort:```\ndef BubbleSort(list):\n    for a in range(len(list)): \n      for b in range(len(list)):# I could start this loop from 1\n        if list[a]< list[b]:   # to avoid comparing the first element twice\n          temp=list[a]\n          list[a]=list[b]\n          list[b]=temp\n    return list\n```\nI browsed the net and books - but found no Python implementation of bubble sort.\nWhat's wrong with the above?", "Answer": "Several things:```\n\nthe algorihm will not always sort correctly;\nsyntactically it seems to sort the opposite way;\nit takes twice the amount of time necessary to perform bubble sort;\nit is not bubblesort; and\nyou better never use variables in Python named list, dict, etc.\n```\nBubbeSort sorts by comparing two adjacent elements: the so-called \"bubble\". If checks if the left item is indeed less than the right one. If this is not the case, it swaps the elements. The algorithm iterates maximum n times over the list, after which it is guaranteed to be sorted.So a very basic implementation would be:```\ndef BubbleSort(data):\n    for _ in range(len(data)):  # iterate n times\n        for i in range(len(data)-1):  # i is the left index of the bubble\n            if data[i+1] > data[i]:  # if the left item is greater\n                # perform a swap\n                temp = data[i]\n                data[i] = data[i+1]\n                data[i+1] = temp\n    return data```\n```\nNow we can improve the algorithm (approximately let the algorithm work in half the time) by stopping at len(data)-1-j, since after each iteration, the right most element over which the bubble has moved is guaranteed to be the maximum:```\n```\ndef BubbleSort(data):\n    for j in range(len(data)):  # iterate n times\n        for i in range(len(data)-1-j):  # i is the left index of the bubble\n            if data[i+1] > data[i]:  # if the left item is greater\n                # perform a swap\n                temp = data[i]\n                data[i] = data[i+1]\n                data[i+1] = temp\n    return data```\nBut using bubblesort is - except for some very rare cases - inefficient. It is better to use faster algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and TimSort (the builtin sorting algorithm of Python).", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
