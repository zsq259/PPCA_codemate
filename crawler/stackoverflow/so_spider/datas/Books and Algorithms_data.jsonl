{"Question": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' Recognition\r\n                \r\nOne of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about image processing. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola 'cans' (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the green rectangle with scale and rotation.\n\n\n\nSome constraints on the project:\n\n\nThe background could be very noisy.\nThe can could have any scale or rotation or even orientation (within reasonable limits).\nThe image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).\nThere could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the can!\nThe brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely \"too much\" on color detection).\nThe can could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.\nThere could be no can at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.\n\n\nSo you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):\n\n\n\nI did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:\n\nLanguage: Done in C++ using OpenCV library.\n\nPre-processing: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:\n\n\nChanging color domain from RGB to HSV and filtering based on \"red\" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n  \nNoise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.\nUsing Canny Edge Detection Filter to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from this awesome book on feature extraction and called Generalized Hough Transform (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:\n\n\nYou can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).\nIt is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.\nIt uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will \"learn\".\nEach pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.\n\n\nIn the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:\n\n\n\nOnce you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...\n\nResults: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:\n\n\nIt is extremely slow! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.\nIt was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)\nFuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.\nIn-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.\n\n\nCan you help me improve my specific algorithm, using exclusively OpenCV features, to resolve the four specific issues mentioned?\n\nI hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nAn alternative approach would be to extract features (keypoints) using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) or Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF).\nYou can find a nice ```\nOpenCV```\n code example in ```\nJava```\n, ```\nC++```\n, and ```\nPython```\n on this page: Features2D + Homography to find a known object\nBoth algorithms are invariant to scaling and rotation. Since they work with features, you can also handle occlusion (as long as enough keypoints are visible).\n\nImage source: tutorial example\nThe processing takes a few hundred ms for SIFT, SURF is bit faster, but it not suitable for real-time applications.

If I learn from one of these, I would like to choose a programming language to code and run the algorithms in.  \n\nThen, there are other books which introduce DS & A concepts with examples written in a particular programming laguage - and I would like to code these algorithms as well - thus, to a certain extent, the language picks the book too.\n\nEither way, I have to pick a language, and I would prefer to stick to one throughout. Setting aside personal language preferences, which one is best for this purpose?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe answer to this question depends on exactly what you want to learn.\n\nPython and Ruby\n\nHigh-level languages like Python and Ruby are often suggested because they are high level and the syntax is quite readable. However, these languages all have abstractions for the common data structures. There's nothing stopping you implementing your own versions as a learning exercise but you may find that you're building high-level data structures on top of other high-level data structures, which isn't necessarily useful.\n\nAlso, Ruby and Python are dynamically-typed languages. This can be good but it can also be confusing for the beginner and it can be harder (initially) to catch errors since they typically won't be apparent until runtime.\n\nC\n\nC is at the other extreme. It's good if you want to learn really low-level details like how the memory is managed but memory management is suddenly an important consideration, as in, correct usage of malloc()/free(). That can be distracting. Also, C isn't object-oriented. That's not a bad thing but simply worth noting.\n\nC++\n\nC++ has been mentioned. As I said in the comment, I think this is a terrible choice. C++ is hideously complicated even in simple usage and has a ridiculous amount of \"gotchas\". Also, C++ has no common base class. This is important because data structures like hash tables rely on there being a common base class. You could implement a version for a nominal base class but it's a little less useful.\n\nJava\n\nJava has also been mentioned. Many people like to hate Java and it's true that the language is extremely verbose and lacking in some of the more modern language features (eg closures) but none of that really matters. Java is statically typed and has garbage collection. This means the Java compiler will catch many errors that dynamically typed languages won't (until runtime) and there's no dealing with segmentation faults (which isn't to say you can't leak memory in Java; obviously you can). I think Java is a fine choice.\n\nC#\n\nC# the language is like a more modern version of Java. Like Java, it is a managed (garbage collected) intermediate compiled language that runs on a virtual machine. Every other language listed here apart from C/C++ also run on a virtual machine but Python, Ruby, etc are interpreted directly rather than compiled to bytecode.\n\nC# has the same pros and cons as Java, basically.\n\nHaskell (etc)\n\nLastly, you have functional languages: Haskell, OCaml, Scheme/Lisp, Clojure, F#, etc. These think about all problems in a very different way and are worth learning at some point but again it comes down to what you want to learn: functional programming or data structures? I'd stick to learning one thing at a time rather than confusing the issue. If you do learn a functional language at some point (which I would recommend), Haskell is a safe and fine choice.\n\nMy Advice\n\nPick Java or C#. Both have free, excellent IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ Community Edition for Java, Visual Studio Express for C#, Visual studio community edition) that make writing and running code a snap. If you use no native data structure more complex than an array and any object you yourself write you'll learn basically the same thing as you would in C/C++ but without having to actually manage memory.\n\nLet me explain: an extensible hash table needs to be resized if sufficient elements are added. In any implementation that will mean doing something like doubling the size of the backing data structure (typically an array) and copying in the existing elements. The implementation is basically the same in all imperative languages but in C/C++ you have to deal with segmentation faults when you don't allocate or deallocate something correctly.\n\nPython or Ruby (it doesn't really matter which) would be my next choice (and very close to the other two) just because the dynamic typing could be problematic at first.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Questions regarding code in a Data Structures and Algorithms book\r\n                \r\nI have been refreshing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms using a book. I came across some sample code in the book, including some run time analysis values that I cannot seem to make sense of. I don't know if I am overthinking this or I am missing something extremely simple. Please help me out.\n\n\nThis is the case where they explain the logic behind adding an element at a specific index in a list. I get the logic, it is pretty simple. Move all the elements, starting with the rightmost one, one index to the right to make space for the element at the index. The code for this in the book is given by:\n\n```\nfor j in range(self._n, k, −1): \n    self._A[j] = self._A[j−1]```\n\n\nWhat I do not get is the range of the loop. Technically, ```\nself._n```\n is equivalent to ```\nlen(list)```\n (an internal state maintained by the list). And if you start at ```\nlen(list)```\n, you are immediately at an ```\nIndexOutOfBoundError```\n. Secondly, even if that were not true, the loop replaces ```\nn```\n with ```\nn-1```\n. Nowhere does it actually move ```\nn```\n to ```\nn+1```\n first, so that value is lost. Am I missing something here?  I actually tried these conditions out on the Python interpreter and they seem to validate my understanding.\nSome of the run time analyses for list operations seems to confuse me. For example:\n```\ndata.index(value) --> O(k+1)\nvalue in data --> O(k+1)\ndata1 == data2 (similarly !=, <, <=, >, >=) --> O(k+1)\ndata[j:k] --> O(k−j+1)```\n\n\nI do not get why the ```\n+1```\n at the end of each running time analysis. Let us consider the ```\ndata.index(value)```\n operation, which basically returns the first index at which a certain value is found. At the worst case, it should iterate through all ```\nn```\n elements of the list, but if not, if the search finds something at index ```\nk```\n, then it returns from there. Why the ```\nO(k+1)```\n there? The same logic applies to the other cases too, especially the list slicing. When you slice a list, isn't it just ```\nO(k-j)```\n? On the contrary, the actual indices are ```\nj```\n to ```\nk-1```\n. \n\n\nThis understanding should be quite elementary and I really feel silly not being able to understand it. Or I don't know if there are genuine errata in the book and I understand it correctly. Could someone please clarify this for me? Help is much appreciated.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nNote (from the comments): the book in question is Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser, and the questions are about pages 202 to 204.\n\nIf you actually look at the whole definition of ```\ninsert```\n from the book, it makes more sense.\n\n```\ndef insert(self, k, value):\n    if self.n == self.capacity:\n        self.resize(2 * self.capacity)\n\n    for j in range(self.n, k, −1):\n        self.A[j] = self.A[j−1]\n\n    self.A[k] = value\n    self.n += 1\n```\n\n\nThe first line implies that ```\nself.n```\n is the number of elements, and corresponds to the index past-the-end, which means that, for a user of the list, accessing it at that index would be erroneous. But this code belongs to the list, and because it has a capacity in addition to a size, it can use ```\nself.A[n]```\n if ```\nself.n < self.capacity```\n (which is true when the for loop starts).\n\nThe loop simply moves the last element (at index ```\nn-1```\n) to the next space in memory, which is out of bounds for a user, but not internaly. At the end, ```\nn```\n is incremented to reflect the new size, and ```\nn-1```\n becomes the index of that \"next space in memory\", which now contains the last element.\n\nAs for the time complexity of the different operations: well, they are not incorrect. Even though ```\nO(n+1) = O(n)```\n, you can still write ```\nO(n+1)```\n if you want to, and it might be more \"precise\" in some cases.\n\nFor example, it is written that ```\ndata.index(value)```\n has a complexity of ```\nO(k+1)```\n, with ```\nk```\n the index of the value being search for. Well, if that value is at the very beginning, then ```\nk = 0```\n and the complexity is ```\nO(0+1) = O(1)```\n. And it's true: if you always search for a value that you know is at the very beginning, even though this operation is pointless, it has a constant time complexity. If you initially wrote ```\nO(k)```\n instead, then you would get ```\nO(0)```\n for that last operation, which I have never seen used, but would make me think that the operation is instantaneous.\n\nThe same thing happens for slicing: they probably wrote ```\nO(k−j+1)```\n because if you only take one element, then ```\nj = k```\n and the complexity is ```\nO(1)```\n instead of ```\nO(0)```\n.\n\nNote that time complexity isn't usually defined in terms of the actual indices of a particular application of the function, but instead in terms of the total number of elements in the container on which the function is used. You can think of it as the mean complexity for using the function with every possible index, which in the cases of ```\nindex```\n and slicing, is simply ```\nO(n)```\n.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Algorithm to assign library books to members such that maximum members are satisfied\r\n                \r\nI was given a problem in a class test. In a library, each member requested for four books and each book was requested by only two members. This information is given in the form of bipartite graph G = ( X + Y , E )\n\nX : Set of all members\nY : Set of all books\nEdge E = set of edges (x,y) where x is a member requested for book y.\nWe have to find the way librarian can give maximum two books to each member such that maximum members are satisfied.\n\nI came out with two approaches:\n\n\nIntroduce two new vertices s(source) and t(destination). Introduce edges from s to all members in X with capacity 2. All edges E has capacity 1 and new edges Y to t has capacity 1. Now apply Max flow algorithm to find maximum matching. The maximum matching is the required solution.\nThe other way is to follow same algorithm as above by introducing same edges but the capacity of each edge is 1. Now find maximum matching. This matching will give one book to maximum members. Remove the matched books and again apply above algorithm. Again remove the matched books and the members who have got two books and again apply algorithm until no edge between X and Y remain. The achieved solution is the required solution.\n\n\nAlthough I got above algorithm but I am not sure which is correct or none is correct.

{"Question": "Can I add a new header in a circular doubly linked list?\r\n                \r\nI just had a assessment about data structures and algorithms. And my teacher said that it is impossible to add a new node before the header. I have checked everywhere (on the internet and books) and it all said that is was possible.\n\nSo now my question is, who is right here?\n\nEDIT: Here is a picture of the situation, add the red arrow I need to insert a new node. \n\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nYou can add a first element easily (in one step) even either to the usual linked list or double-linked one. You are right.\n\n\nThe new element will get the pointer to the old first element. \nFor double-linked list also the old first element gets back reference to the new element.  \nThe new element becomes the first one and is addressed as the list.\n\n\nBut be very soft and careful telling the teacher about his/her mistake. Maybe: \"you meant inserting the last element in one step for the non-circular doubly linked list really, didn't you?\" :-) I hope, you teacher is not the kind of person that gets easily offended hearing complex sentences.\n\nAs for the circular doubly linked list, you can insert both last or first element in one step. For the insert at head:\n\n\nA new element gets reference to the old first and the back reference to the last ( from the old head back reference)\nOld first changes its back reference to the new first\nLast changes its reference to the new first.\nHead (if you have one as a special something that has not data and is not a node) changes the reference to the new first. Edit According to your picture, you have not such thing. \n\n\nYou can also insert any element into any list, but it could take many steps moving from one element to another, for to reach the place.\n\nEdit \nMaybe, your teacher really meant that special reference that references the circular list from outside and has not its own data. It can exist for some special need. The very question of putting something into the list before the header has not sense at all - for the header does not belong to that part of the structure where the word before is defined. The element that is before the first element, is not outside the list, but it is the last element of the list. \n\nThat header, of course, can have something referencing it. The header is merely a reference, and it can have another \"header of the header\" and so on. \n\n```\nBig fleas have little fleas,\nUpon their backs to bite 'em,\nAnd little fleas have lesser fleas,\nand so, ad infinitum.\n```\n\n\nAnd only an act of human will or some technical or religious limitation can forbide the possibility to reference a reference.\n\nSo, if the question (how to put something before the header) has sense, the word \"before\" for header must be interpreted as \"referencing to\", and we can put something before it. If \"before\" is defined for list nodes only, the question itself is senseless.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

I just wonder what is the best way to learn data structures and algorithms, especially for the \"reading fundamentals\" phase. \n\nI'm not sure if it is efficient if I try to memorize the code in books before turning to problems.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nDon't just memorise code; that won't get you very far. Instead, understand it. (If you are finding that hard, find a better resource.) Why does it do that?\n\nData structures are always something I've always found make intuitive sense, and that's because I saw through the code. A 1D list? One thing after another. 2D list? A list of numbers, and several lists at the positions indicated by the numbers (like the Table of Contents in a book). A linked list? A sort of conga line, where each item is holding onto the next (but they're probably not in an orderly row). Look at each data structure you come across, and work out what it looks like and what it's for.\n\nAlgorithms are a bit trickier. Let's take merge sort as an example. It splits a list roughly in half, sorts each sub-list, then merges them back together by taking the smallest number from the top of each pile. Because they're sorted, the top of each pile is guaranteed to be smaller than the rest of the pile, so the smallest number out of the tops of the two piles is guaranteed to be the smallest overall and so the next item in the correctly sorted list.\n\nSince merge sort sorts lists, you can use it as its own \"sort each sub-list\" function. In order to stop that carrying on forever, though, it needs to check for a 1-long list at the beginning and return that list, since that's already sorted and it would carry on forever if it split that, sorted it by splitting it and sorting it by splitting ...\n\nThere. Merge sort described in the way that I store it in my head. You'll see no code there, and that's because in different situations I'd implement it differently. In C code for a low-RAM system I might make it sort a list pretty much in-place by alternating between two copies of the list, with only an O(n) heap and O(log n) stack requirement.

We can fix it by doing this:\n\n```\nint i = 0; // This is probably what was intended\nfor(; isalnum(ch); i++) { // process this term:\n```\n\n\nWhy can't I modify string literals?\n\nImagine if you could do \n\n```\n5 = 10; // This is complete and utter nonsense. \n```\n\n\nThis doesn't make any sense! You can't assign 5 to 10. In the same way, this is also nonsense:\n\n```\n\"hello\" = \"blarg\"; // This is also nonsense\n```\n\n\n```\n\"hello\"```\n is always ```\n\"hello\"```\n, and never anything else. If the compiler allowed you to write\n\n```\n\"hello\"[0] = 'H'; // This is also nonsense\n```\n\n\nThis would be modifying ```\n\"hello\"```\n, which could just... break your program. It's wrong; it's evil. In fact, the string literal \"hello\" might even be placed in a section of memory that's flagged as ```\nconst```\n by the Operating System itself. \n\nWhy does the compiler give you the error (or warning)\n\nIf you have ```\nchar*```\n, that is a pointer to a char. If you have ```\nconst char*```\n, that is a pointer to a const char. If you could go from ```\nconst char*```\n to ```\nchar*```\n, this would allow you to modify ```\nconst```\n memory, which could break the program:\n\n```\n// If you could do this, you could modify \"hello\"\n// Modifying \"hello\" is nonsense, so this should be nonsense too:\nchar* s = \"hello\"; \ns[0] = 'H'; // How you'd modify \"hello\"\n```\n\n\nAs a result, string literals can only be assigned to ```\nconst char*```\n:\n\n```\n// Because s contains const chars, elements of s can't be modified so this is fine\nconst char* s = \"hello\"; // This is OK\n```\n\n\nWhy did the textbook contain the error?\n\nThe language used to let people do really unsafe stuff, like modifying string literals. This is extremely bad practice and it breaks optimizations the compiler uses to make programs smaller and faster. \n\nThe textbook is probably written by someone who's used to writing old, unsafe code. \n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Explanation of a function definition in logic gate code in Problems in Data Structures and Algorithms\r\n                \r\n(I am new to Python and OOP so please let me know if I use nonsensical language at any point.)\n\nThe book Problems in Data Structures and Algorithms implements code for binary and unary logic gates in a hierarchical fashion. Please see the bottom of my question for the full relevant code.\n\nMy particular query is: in the Connector class, in the constructor, there is the line\n\n```\ntgate.setNextPin(self)\n```\n\n\nReferring back to the unary gate where the setNextPin function is defined:\n\n```\ndef setNextPin(self,source):\n    if self.pin == None:\n        self.pin = source\n    else:\n        print(\"Cannot Connect: NO EMPTY PINS on this gate\")\n```\n\n\nThe \"source\" in the function setNextPin is the input of the function setNextPin. So when I see the line tgate.setNextPin(self),  it tells me to go back to the unary class (tgate) to find the function setNextPin, and that the input (\"source\") of the setNextPin function is self, which in this case is an instance of the Connector class. However, I don't really see how this makes sense. I don't see how a connector class could be the input for the variable \"source\" in setNextPin. \n\nThe full code:\n\n```\nclass LogicGate:\n\n    def __init__(self,n):\n        self.name = n\n        self.output = None\n\n    def getName(self):\n        return self.name\n\n    def getOutput(self):\n        self.output = self.performGateLogic()\n        return self.output\n\nclass UnaryGate(LogicGate):\n\n    def __init__(self,n):\n        LogicGate.__init__(self,n)\n\n        self.pin = None\n\n    def getPin(self):\n        if self.pin == None:\n            return int(input(\"Enter Pin input for gate \"+self.getName()+\"-->\"))\n        else:\n            return self.pin.getFrom().getOutput()\n\n    def setNextPin(self,source):\n        if self.pin == None:\n            self.pin = source\n        else:\n            print(\"Cannot Connect: NO EMPTY PINS on this gate\")\n\n\nclass NotGate(UnaryGate):\n\n    def __init__(self,n):\n        UnaryGate.__init__(self,n)\n\n    def performGateLogic(self):\n        if self.getPin():\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return 1\n\n\nclass Connector:\n\n    def __init__(self, fgate, tgate):\n        self.fromgate = fgate\n        self.togate = tgate\n\n        tgate.setNextPin(self)\n\n    def getFrom(self):\n        return self.fromgate\n\n    def getTo(self):\n        return self.togate\n```\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe ```\nConnector```\n class represents the wires that are used to connect logic gates to each other. ```\nsetNextPin()```\n is given a ```\nConnector```\n, and associates this with the ```\npin```\n property. When it wants to get the logic gate that provides its input, it calls ```\nself.pin.getFrom()```\n, which goes to the ```\nConnector```\n ```\ngetFrom()```\n method, which then returns the ```\nConnector```\n's ```\nfromgate```\n property, which will be the gate at the other end of the wire.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

The first loop walks ```\nj```\n through the array, until ```\nj```\n \"points\" to the element with the value of ```\n55```\n. When this happens, the code exits the loop through ```\nbreak```\n, so when the second loop reads ```\nj```\n, it still points to the location in the array where ```\n55```\n is stored.

If checks if the left item is indeed less than the right one. If this is not the case, it swaps the elements. The algorithm iterates maximum n times over the list, after which it is guaranteed to be sorted.\n\nSo a very basic implementation would be:\n\n```\ndef BubbleSort(data):\n    for _ in range(len(data)):  # iterate n times\n        for i in range(len(data)-1):  # i is the left index of the bubble\n            if data[i+1] > data[i]:  # if the left item is greater\n                # perform a swap\n                temp = data[i]\n                data[i] = data[i+1]\n                data[i+1] = temp\n    return data```\n\n\nNow we can improve the algorithm (approximately let the algorithm work in half the time) by stopping at ```\nlen(data)-1-j```\n, since after each iteration, the right most element over which the bubble has moved is guaranteed to be the maximum:\n\n```\ndef BubbleSort(data):\n    for j in range(len(data)):  # iterate n times\n        for i in range(len(data)-1-j):  # i is the left index of the bubble\n            if data[i+1] > data[i]:  # if the left item is greater\n                # perform a swap\n                temp = data[i]\n                data[i] = data[i+1]\n                data[i+1] = temp\n    return data```\n\n\nBut using bubblesort is - except for some very rare cases - inefficient.

In general, if you have two algorithms that are O(n) average case, but one is O(n lg n) worst case, and one is O(n^2) - it may influence your decision on which to go with.  Or it may influence your algorithm design.\n\nExample: quick sort v. merge sort. Both are O(n lg n)  Quicksort's worst case is O(n^2), merge sort is (IIRC) still O(n lg n) - but in general, Quicksort tends to be faster if data fits in memory.  Even though it has a costlier worst case, since we KNOW it has a costlier worst case, we can try to mitigate it (median-of-three instead of just a random partition, etc.) and take advantage of the fact that it usually is faster than mergesort. \n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Delete in Binary Search tree?\r\n                \r\nI am reading through the binary tree delete node algorithm used in the book Data Structures and Algorithms: Annotated Reference with Examples\n\non  page 34 , case 4(Delete node which has both right and left sub trees), following algorithm described in the book looks doesn't work, probably I may be wrong could someone help me what I am missing. \n\n```\n//Case 4\nget largestValue from nodeToRemove.Left\nFindParent(largestValue).Right <- 0\nnodeToRemove.Value<-largestValue.Value\n```\n\n\nHow does the following line deletes the largest value from sub tree ```\nFindParent(largestValue).Right <- 0```\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nWhen deleting a node with two children, you can either choose its in-order successor node or its in-order predecessor node. In this case it's finding the the largest value in the left sub-tree (meaning the right-most child of its left sub-tree), which means that it is finding the node's in-order predecessor node.\n\nOnce you find the replacement node, you don't actually delete the node to be deleted. Instead you take the value from the successor node and store that value in the node you want to delete. Then, you delete the successor node. In doing so you preserve the binary search-tree property since you can be sure that the node you selected will have a value that is lower than the values of all the children in the original node's left sub-tree, and greater that than the values of all the children in the original node's right sub-tree.\n\nEDIT\n\nAfter reading your question a little more, I think I have found the problem.\n\nTypically what you have in addition to the ```\ndelete```\n function is a ```\nreplace```\n function that replaces the node in question. I think you need to change this line of code:\n\n```\nFindParent(largestValue).Right <- 0\n```\n\n\nto:\n\n```\nFindParent(largestValue).Right <- largestValue.Left\n```\n\n\nIf the ```\nlargestValue```\n node doesn't have a left child, you simply get ```\nnull```\n or ```\n0```\n. If it does have a left child, that child becomes a replacement for the ```\nlargestValue```\n node. So you're right; the code doesn't take into account the scenario that the ```\nlargestValue```\n node might have a left child.\n\nAnother EDIT\n\nSince you've only posted a snippet, I'm not sure what the context of the code is. But the snippet as posted does seem to have the problem you suggest (replacing the wrong node). Usually, there are three cases, but I notice that the comment in your snippet says ```\n//Case 4```\n (so maybe there is some other context).\n\nEarlier, I alluded to the fact that ```\ndelete```\n usually comes with a ```\nreplace```\n. So if you find the ```\nlargestValue```\n node, you delete it according to the two simple cases (node with no children, and node with one child). So if you're looking at pseudo-code to delete a node with two children, this is what you'll do:\n\n```\nget largestValue from nodeToRemove.Left\nnodeToRemove.Value <- largestValue.Value\n\n//now replace largestValue with largestValue.Left    \n\nif largestValue = largestValue.Parent.Left then   \n   largestValue.Parent.Left <- largestValue.Left //is largestValue a left child?\nelse //largestValue must be a right child\n   largestValue.Parent.Right <- largestValue.Left\n\nif largestValue.Left is not null then\n   largestValue.Left.Parent <- largestValue.Parent\n```\n\n\nI find it strange that a Data Structures And Algorithms book would leave out this part, so I am inclined to think that the book has further split up the deletion into a few more cases (since there are three standard cases) to make it easier to understand.\n\nTo prove that the above code works, consider the following tree:\n\n```\n  8\n / \\\n7   9\n```\n\n\nLet's say that you want to delete ```\n8```\n. You try to find ```\nlargestValue```\n from ```\nnodeToRemove.Left```\n. This gives you ```\n7```\n since the left sub-tree only has one child. \n\nThen you do:\n\n```\nnodeToRemove.Value <- largestValue.Value\n```\n\n\nWhich means:\n\n```\n8.value <- 7.Value\n```\n\n\nor\n\n```\n8.Value <- 7\n```\n\n\nSo now your tree looks like this:\n\n```\n  7\n / \\\n7   9\n```\n\n\nYou need to get rid of the replacement node and so you're going to replace ```\nlargestValue```\n with ```\nlargestValue.Left```\n (which is ```\nnull```\n). So first you find out what kind of child ```\n7```\n is:\n\n```\nif largestValue = largestValue.Parent.Left then\n```\n\n\nWhich means:\n\n```\nif 7 = 7.Parent.Left then\n```\n\n\nor:\n\n```\nif 7 = 8.Left then\n```\n\n\nSince ```\n7```\n is ```\n8```\n's left child, need to replace ```\n8.Left```\n with ```\n7.Right```\n (```\nlargestValue.Parent.Left <- largestValue.Left```\n). Since ```\n7```\n has no children, ```\n7.Left```\n is null. So ```\nlargestValue.Parent.Left```\n gets assigned to null (which effectively removes its left child). So this means that you end up with the following tree:\n\n```\n  7\n   \\\n    9\n```\n\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

I don't want the answer, I just need some help on where to even begin. The teacher recites from the book, which is some help, but not much. There is base code below with a space that I am meant to fill in. Thank you for any help you can give me. \n\nStacks are used by compilers to evaluate expressions and generate machine-language code. Humans generally write expressions like 3 + 4 and 7 / 9, in which the operator (+ or / here) is written between its operands. This is called inﬁx notation. To evaluate a complex inﬁx expression, a compiler would ﬁrst convert the expression to postﬁx notation, in which the operator is written to the right of its two operands. The preceding inﬁx expressions would appear in postﬁx notation as 3 4 + and 7 9 /, respectively. You are required to write a Java program to evaluate an expression in postﬁx notation and display the result. Assume that an expression ONLY contains parentheses, single-digit integers (as operands) and the following operators: “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”, “%”. The expressions in inﬁx notation are given in the ﬁle InﬁxExpressions.txt. The corresponding expressions in postﬁx notation are given in the ﬁle PostﬁxExpressions.txt. Your program should read the expressions from the ﬁle PostﬁxExpressions.txt, evaluate each postﬁx expression, and display the result in a tabular report.

{"Question": "Do we do algorithm analysis based on a model of computation or do we do it based on \"common sense\"?\r\n                \r\nRecently, I was reading these books about algorithms, specifically the section about analysis of algorithms: \n\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms. 3rd ed. TCRC\nAlgorithm Design Manual. 2nd ed. S. Skiena\nAlgorithm Design. J.Kleinberg & Eva Tardos  \nAlgorithms. 4th ed. R. Sedgewick \nAlgorithms. S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou & Vazirani\na few other books\n\n\nAfter that, I got a bit confused because I don't fully understand the origin of counting steps of algorithms.\n\nI mean, in Introduction to Algorithms and Algorithm Design Manual, something called the RAM model of computation is mentioned. In these books, it is said that under that model we count steps, but in the others books a model of computation as such is not mentioned. \n\nThe other books talk about counting steps of the path that the algorithm travels, that is, in a common sense way or in a logical way. So, I would appreciate if you guys could help me with these questions:\n\nWhat's the relationship(or difference) between the step count method (other books) and using a model of computation (TCRC & S. Skiena) to do it?\nWhen someone talks about counting steps to analyze algorithms, may I assume he is referring to using a model of computation(RAM)?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nOur common sense is based on a model of computation that can be implicit or explicit.  Usually in an introductory course it is left implicit.  Explicitly what you use is usually the RAM model.  Which is based on the idea of sequential processing, where each simple operation takes constant time.  So you just count steps.\n\nYou can find a formal description of that model at http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~cs125/fall14/lec6.pdf.\n\nReality is, of course, rather different.  As https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832 shows, operations take wildly different amounts of time.  I've personally seen jobs go from 5 days to 1 hour by switching to using a sort instead of hash lookups.  Yes, hash lookups are ```\nO(1)```\n, but with a horrible constant when data is backed by disk.  Distributed computing has things operating in parallel.  Computing on a GPU gives you a tremendous amount of parallelism..as long as all computation operates in perfect lockstep.  We are trying to build quantum computers, which can theoretically give would give us many, many orders of magnitude more parallelism..at the cost of losing irreversible operations like \"if\".\n\nWe can create models that deal with all of this complexity.  But there is no need to consider any of it until you understand the basics.

{"Question": "Supplement code for the \"Algorithms in Java, part 5\" book (Sedgewick)\r\n                \r\nWe are having an \"Advanced Algorithms\" curriculum at my college and each of us got an assignment to describe a specific algorithm from the \"Algorithms in Java\" book. We also have to implement the code from the book (in Java of course) to show how the algorithm works on a concrete example.\n\nThe classes which we have to use for graphs, nodes, edges etc. are already available in the book, but it seems to me (and to some other students) that the code has a few errors that prevent it to compile. \n\nThe only implementation I managed to find was this:\nhttp://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/Algs3.java5/code.txt\nBut that is the same code from the book, and it doesn't work. \n\nThe code I'm having problem with is here:\n\n```\n  GraphSPT(Graph G, int s)  \n  { int V = G.V(), N = 0;\n    wt = new double[V]; spt = new Edge[V]; \n    for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) wt[v] = maxWT; \n    intQueue Q = new intQueue(G.E());\n    wt[s] = 0.0; Q.put(s);  Q.put(V);\n    while (!Q.empty()) \n    { int v;\n      while ((v = Q.get()) == V) \n        { if (N++ > V) return; Q.put(V); }\n      AdjList A = G.getAdjList(v);\n      for (Edge e = A.beg(); !A.end(); e = A.nxt()) /* this line is the one with the problem */\n        { int w = e.other(v); \n          double P = wt[v] + e.wt();\n          if (P < wt[w]) \n            { wt[w] = P; Q.put(w); spt[w] = e; }\n        }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n\nI marked the problematic line. AdjList in the line before is an interface, but the getAdjList() method returns an instance of the AdjLinkedList class, which contains implementations of the beg(), end() and nxt() methods. The problem occurs because they return integers, and not instances of the Edge class.

{"Question": "Do equal elements preserve their order in Insertion Sort algorithm?\r\n                \r\nIn the \"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java\" book of Robert Lafore it is stated that the Insertion Sort is a stable algorithm. Which means that equal items preserve their order.\n\nHere is the example from the book:\n\n```\npublic void insertionSort() {\n    int in, out;\n    for (out = 1; out < nElems; out++) // out is dividing line\n    {\n        long temp = a[out]; // remove marked item\n        in = out; // start shifts at out\n        while (in > 0 && a[in - 1] >= temp) // until one is smaller,\n        {\n            a[in] = a[in - 1]; // shift item right,\n            --in; // go left one position\n        }\n        a[in] = temp; // insert marked item\n    } // end for\n} // end insertionSort()\n```\n\n\nIn the ```\nwhile```\n cycle we are going left and seeking for a place for ```\ntemp```\n variable. And even if ```\na[in - 1] == temp```\n, we still move one step left and insert ```\ntmp```\n before ```\na[in - 1]```\n while in the original array ```\ntmp```\n was to the right of ```\na[in - 1]```\n.\n\nThe order of array elements changed after the sorting. How is this algorithm is stable then? Shouldn't there just be ```\na[in - 1] > temp```\n instead of ```\na[in - 1] >= temp```\n? \n\nMaybe i'm just making a mistake and don't see something obvious?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nYou are absolutely right.

{"Question": "Why is theta notation never used?\r\n                \r\nI'm studying a degree in computer science and at class we're using big-theta notation much more often than big-O notation. Although while reading articles about algorithms and its running times, I hardly ever find the big-theta notation anywhere. Why isn't theta notation used to indicate worst case of running time for algorithms in a more fitted way in most books and articles?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\n\nBig-O is an upper bound.\nBig-Theta is a tight bound, i.e. upper and lower bound.\n\n\nWhen people only worry about what's the worst that can happen, big-O is sufficient; i.e. it says that \"it can't get much worse than this\". The tighter the bound the better, of course, but a tight bound isn't always easy to compute [1].\n\n\n\nThe following opinion [2] will give you a better understanding:\n\nAs people said, big-Theta is a two-sided bound. Strictly speaking, you should use it when you want to explain that that is how well an algorithm can do, and that either that algorithm can't do better or that no algorithm can do better. For instance, if you say \"Sorting requires Θ(n(log n)) comparisons for worst-case input\", then you're explaining that there is a sorting algorithm that uses O(n(log n)) comparisons for any input; and that for every sorting algorithm, there is an input that forces it to make Ω(n(log n)) comparisons.\n\nNow, one narrow reason that people use O instead of Ω is to drop disclaimers about worst or average cases. If you say \"sorting requires O(n(log n)) comparisons\", then the statement still holds true for favorable input. Another narrow reason is that even if one algorithm to do X takes time Θ(f(n)), another algorithm might do better, so you can only say that the complexity of X itself is O(f(n)).\n\nHowever, there is a broader reason that people informally use O. At a human level, it's a pain to always make two-sided statements when the converse side is \"obvious\" from context. Since I'm a mathematician, I would ideally always be careful to say \"I will take an umbrella if and only if it rains\" or \"I can juggle 4 balls but not 5\", instead of \"I will take an umbrella if it rains\" or \"I can juggle 4 balls\". But the other halves of such statements are often obviously intended or obviously not intended. It's just human nature to be sloppy about the obvious. It's confusing to split hairs.\n\nUnfortunately, in a rigorous area such as math or theory of algorithms, it's also confusing not to split hairs. People will inevitably say O when they should have said Ω or Θ. Skipping details because they're \"obvious\" always leads to misunderstandings. There is no solution for that.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Afterwards you can put the data in an array. This makes it very easy to split the work (runnables) onto several workers (threads in threadpool) by partitioning the indexes. You can use any of the concurrent data structures to store the matching indexes.\nAlso because you are working with DNA you only need 2 bits to store one element (4 acids). Instead of strings you could have int arrays (values 0 - 3) or BitSets. Like this you could easily calculate a rolling hash. This could improve the search speed of a fragment in whole DNA a lot, especially if the fragments are long.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

He uses Queue data structure to achieve it.  To demarcate levels next to each other null is used as level marker.\n\nFor eg. He first inserts root, then null marker. In while loop first iteration, first element from queue is removed and it's left and right  children if not null are added to the queue. When next element is removed, it will be null denoting the end of level 1. Now if the queue is not empty there could be many other levels. So null marker is inserted again.\n\nNote:- whenever null is element being removed from the queue, it means that there are no more elements in current level and all its children in next level are added to queue and no more elements in the next level are remaining.

On the plus side, the examples, exercises, and explanations can be very concrete. Provided you have access to an execution environment for that language, you can experiment on your own with the concepts as you are learning them. This is very powerful.\n\nOn the minus side, it is harder to distinguish between the core concepts (e.g., nodes and links in a tree) and the language-specific methods for implementing them (e.g., structs and pointers in C). Other languages may be so different (e.g., Prolog), that the core concepts may be totally unrecognizable if you haven't learned how to separate them from the language-specific aspects of what you have learned. There's also the problem that there are usually lots of language-specific stuff that are entirely a distraction from the core concepts. (malloc/free in C; constructors and destructors in C++, etc., -- unless you're studying memory management algorithms.)\n\nOne way to have the benefits of a language-specific presentation and also address its shortcomings is to study the same material presented for two radically different languages. The entire family of Algol-like languages (C, C++, Pascal, Algol, Java, C#, etc.) are basically equivalent for this purpose. I mentioned Prolog before; you might also consider Lisp. Another interesting approach might be a 4GL language like SQL. If you can implement a good balanced tree in a C program and also in an SQL schema and set of queries, then you can be confident that you have mastered the underlying concepts involved in balanced trees.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Luckily (for 64 bit machines) ```\nInt```\n is sufficient.  For portability sake you should probably rewrite my code to use ```\nInt64```\n or ```\nWord64```\n (C isn't the only language with a ```\nlong```\n).\n\n\n  Question 2: Why is haskell so slow?

The answer was \n\n\n0) Use optimization via ```\n-O2```\n \n1) Use fast  (notably: unbox-able) types when possible \n2) ```\nrem```\n not ```\nmod```\n (a frequently forgotten optimization) and \n3) worker/wrapper transformation (perhaps the most common optimization).\n\n\n\n  Question 4: Do my functional implementations permit LCO and hence\n  avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?\n\n\nYes, that wasn't the issue.

{"Question": "Should nodes of trees and similar data structures be visible to the outside?\r\n                \r\nI've read \"Michael T. Goodrich's Data Structures and Algorithms in Java\" book and often stumbled about method signatures like the following example taken from the tree section:\n\n```\npublic Position<E> parent(Position<E> v)```\n\n\nTo me the proposed API looks a bit weird. I don't understand why they make the ```\nPosition```\n class/objects available to the outside world. Personally I would have created something like this:\n\n```\npublic E parent(E e)```\n\n\nI see that, given that the ```\nPosition```\n stores a reference to it's parent, the second variant is slower because the method first has to locate ```\ne```\n's ```\nPosition```\n object within the tree. Whereas the first method could return the reference in constant time.\n\nBut the version from the book would allow the member function ```\nparent()```\n to run even with position objects not stored in the associated tree, which in my opinion is very strange.\n\nAre there any good reasons for the first version I'm not taking into account?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nWhy is it strange to call ```\nparent()```\n on objects that are not in the tree? You can do that with the second version too, i.e. you could call ```\nparent(E)```\n on some ```\nE```\n that's not in the tree.\n\nGenerally, I think exposing the tree structure makes sense when what you are providing to the users is a tree. If you were for example creating an associative array, using a tree, you shouldn't even expose the ```\nparent()```\n method.\n\nOther reason for the first one might be that some ```\nE```\n might not be unique in the tree. So if some ```\nE```\n is in the tree twice, each time with different parent, it's unclear what should ```\nparent(E)```\n return. ```\nparent(Position<E>)```\n doesn't have this problem.\n\nAnd the performance reason can be significant too.

{"Question": "Why ReentrantLock algorithm from book is not working?\r\n                \r\nToday I read Nir Shavit, Maurice Herlihy, The Art of Multiprocessor Programming and came across one very incomprehensible (for me personally) thing.\n\nSo, i found implementation of ReentrantLock in java (for me it's page 188, chapter 8):\n\n```\nclass SimpleReentrantLock implements Lock {\n\n    Lock lock;\n    Condition condition;\n    long owner, holdCount;\n\n    SimpleReentrantLock() {\n        lock = new SimpleLock();\n        condition = lock.newCondition();\n        owner = 0;\n        holdCount = 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void lock() {\n        long me = Thread.currentThread().getId();\n        lock.lock();\n        if (owner == me) {\n            holdCount++;\n            return;\n        }\n\n        while (holdCount != 0) {\n            try {\n                condition.await();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n\n        owner = me;\n        holdCount = 1L;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void unlock() {\n        lock.lock();\n        try {\n            if (holdCount == 0 || owner != Thread.currentThread().getId()) {\n                throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();\n            }\n\n            holdCount--;\n            if (holdCount == 0) {\n                condition.signal();\n            }\n        } finally {\n            lock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n    // Other methods for Lock interface...\n}\n```\n\n\nI analyzed this code and still not fully understand it.\n\nSo, i can use ```\nReentrantLock```\n from ```\njava.util.concurrent.locks```\n in such way:\n\n```\nlock.lock();\nlock.lock();\n// Some code here...\nlock.unlock();\nlock.unlock();\n```\n\n\nAnd it will be OK, because it's ReentrantLock, i can acquire critical section multiple times.\n\nFor example, you can find spin-lock implementation from this book:\n\n```\nclass TASLock implements Lock {\n    private AtomicBoolean state = new AtomicBoolean(false);\n\n    @Override\n    public void lock() {\n        while(state.getAndSet(true));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void unlock() {\n        state.set(false);\n    }\n\n    // Other Lock methods...\n}\n```\n\n\nThis implementation is working as expected.\n\nSo, you can notice from ```\nSimpleReentrantLock```\n next thing:\n\n```\n lock = new SimpleLock();\n```\n\n\nAs author tell us:\n\n\n  we initialize the internal lock field to an object of a (fictitious) SimpleLock class which is is presumably not reentrant\n\n\nBut actually, i have implementation of non-reentrant lock (```\nTASLock```\n), so i will do next inlining:\n\n```\nlock = new TTASLock();\n```\n\n\nAnd finally, when i will try to execute next code, i will get deadlock:\n\n```\nnew Thread(() -> {\n            lock.lock();\n            lock.lock();\n            System.out.println(\"No deadlock found.\");\n            lock.unlock();\n            lock.unlock();\n}).start();\n```\n\n\nAnd it looks pretty clear, because in ```\nlock```\n method we have such code:\n\n```\n lock.lock();\n```\n\n\nWe actually trying to acquire the critical section twice on the same lock object without any preconditions.\n\nIs the wrong algorithm indicated in the book?

Shouldn't it be done like below:\n\n```\n// Returns the total number of nodes in this binary tree (include the root in the count).\npublic static int size(BinaryTreeNode root) {\n    int leftCount = 0;\n    int rightCount = 0;\n    leftCount = leftCount + (root.left == null ? 0 : size(root.left));\n    rightCount = rightCount+ (root.right == null ? 0 : size(root.right));\n    return 1 + leftCount + rightCount;\n}\n```\n\n\nFor some reason both the functions yield same result (7, which is correct) for the Binary Tree below.\n\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nLet me try to explain how it works by stepping through your code using\nthe binary tree you've shown.\n\nYou start by calling ```\nsize```\n with the root node (1). Its left child (2) is not ```\nnull```\n so you call ```\nsize```\n with 2. Its left child (4) is not ```\nnull```\n, so you call ```\nsize```\n with 4. Now, the left of 4 is ```\nnull```\n, so you set ```\nleftCount```\n to ```\n0```\n. The right of 4 is also ```\nnull```\n, so you set ```\nrightCount```\n to ```\n0```\n. Then you return ```\n1 + 0 + 0```\n, which is ```\n1```\n, to the calling function, which is the one with node 2. So, the ```\nleftCount```\n, in the function that was called with node 2, is set to ```\n1```\n. Now, we check the right child of 2, it's not ```\nnull```\n so we call ```\nsize```\n with its right child (5). Again, 5 has no left and no right child, so both ```\nleftCount```\n and ```\nrightCount```\n are set to ```\n0```\n, and the function returns ```\n1 + 0 + 0```\n. Once the call to ```\nsize```\n for the right of 2 returns ```\n1```\n, ```\nrightCount```\n is set to ```\n1```\n. At this point, the function that was called with 2, returns ```\n1 + 1 + 1```\n, which is ```\n3```\n. So, the call to ```\nsize```\n for the left of 1 returns ```\n3```\n, and we then call ```\nsize```\n with the right child of 1 (3). The call to ```\nsize```\n with node 3, does exactly the same things we've seen for the call with node 2, so a count of ```\n3```\n is returned. Finally, the original call with node 1, returns ```\n1 + 3 + 3```\n, which is ```\n7```\n.\n\nIf you want a more visual explanation, I've made a video (find size of binary tree on YouTube) where I first explain the process of finding the size on a high level, then show the code, and run though the code step-by-step with an example (by filling a table with values for variables in each of the function calls, so it's easy to see how the recursion unwinds).\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Thanks!\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nIs the Postgres code mentioned in your comment actually used in production? In my opinion, it really should be reviewed by someone who has at least some understanding of the problem domain. The problem with random sampling algorithms, and random algorithms in general, is that it is very hard to diagnose biased sampling bugs. Most samples \"look random\" if you don't look too hard, and biased sampling is only obvious when you do a biased sample of a biased dataset. Or when your biased sample results in a prediction which is catastrophically divergent from reality, which will eventually happen but maybe not when you're doing the code review.\nAnyway, by way of trying to answer the questions, both the one actually in the text of this post and the ones added or implied in the comment stream:\n\nProperly implemented, Vitter's algorithm Z is much faster than Knuth's algorithm S. If you have a use case in which reservoir sampling is indicated, then you should probably use Vitter, subject to the code testing advice above: Vitter's algorithm is more complicated and it might not be obvious how to validate the implementation.\nI noticed in the Postgres code that it just uses the threshold value of 22 to decide whether to use the more complicated code, based on testing done almost 40 years ago on hardware which you'd be hard pressed to find today. It's possible that 22 is not a bad threshold, but it's just a number pulled out of thin air. At least some attempt should be made to verify or, more likely, correct it.\n\nForty years ago, when those algorithms were developed, large datasets were typically stored on magnetic tape. Magnetic tape is still used today, but applications have changed; I think that you're not likely to find a Postgres installation in which a live database is stored on tape. This matters because the way you get data off a tape drive is radically different from the way you get data from a file server. Or a sharded distributed collection of file servers, which also has its particular needs.\nData on a reel of tape can only be accessed linearly, although it is possible to skip tape somewhat faster than you can read it. On a file server, data is random access; there may be a slight penalty for jumping around in a file, but there might not. (On the sharded distributed model, it might well be faster then linear reads.) But trying to read out of order on a tape drive might turn an input operation which takes an hour into an operation which takes a week. So it's very important to access the sample in order. Moreover, you really don't want to have to read the tape twice, which would take twice as long.\nOne of the other assumptions that was made in those algorithms is that you might not have enough memory to store the entire sample; in 1985, main memory was horribly expensive and databases were already quite large. So a common way to collect a large sample from a huge database was to copy the sampled blocks onto secondary memory, such as another tape drive. But there's a bit of a catch with reservoir sampling: as the sampling algorithm proceeds, some items which were initially inserted in the sample are later replaced with other items. But you can't replace data written on tape, so you need to just keep on appending the newly selected samples. What you do hold in random access memory is a list of locations of the sample; once you've finished selecting the sample, you can sort this list of locations and then use it to read out the final selection in storage order, skipping over the rejected items. That means that the temporary sample storage ends up holding both the final sample, and some number of later rejected items. The O(n(1+log(N/n))) space complexity in Algorithm R refers to precisely this storage, and it's actually a reasonably small multiplier, considering.\nAll that is irrelevant if you can just allocate enough random access storage somewhere to hold the entire sample. Or, even better, if you can directly read a data from the database. There could well still be good reasons to read the sample into local storage, but nothing stops you from updating a block of local storage with a different block.\nOn the other hand, in many common cases, you don't need to read the data in order to sample it. You can just take a list of items numbers, select a sample from that list of the desired size, and then set about acquiring the sample from the list of selected item numbers. And that presents a rather different problem: how to choose an unbiased sample of size ```\nk```\n from a set of ```\nK```\n item indexes.\nThere's a fast and simple solution to that (also described by Knuth, unsurprisingly): make an array of all the item numbers (say, the integers from 0 to ```\nK```\n, and then shuffle the array using the standard Knuth/Fisher-Yates shuffle, with a slight modification: you run the algorithm from front to back (instead of back to front, as it is often presented), and stop after ```\nk```\n iterations. At that point the first ```\nk```\n elements in the partially shuffled array are an unbiased sample. (In fact, you don't need the entire vector of ```\nK```\n indices, as long as ```\nk```\n is much smaller than ```\nK```\n. You're only going to touch O(k) of the values, and you can keep the ones you touched in a hash table of size O(k).)\nAnd there's an even simpler algorithm, again for the case where the sample is small relative to the dataset: just keep one bit for each item in the dataset, which indicates that the item has been selected. Now select ```\nk```\n items at random, marking the bit vector as you go; if the relevant bit is already marked, then that item is already in the sample; you just ignore that selection and continue with the next random choice. The expected number of ignored sample is very small unless the sample size is a significant fraction of the dataset size.\n\nThere's one other criterion which weighed on the minds of Vitter and Knuth: you'll normally want to do something with the selected sample. And given the amount of time it takes to read through a tape, you want to be able to start processing each item immediately as it is accepted. That precludes algorithms which include, for example, \"sort the selected indices and then read the indicated items. (See above.) For immediate processing to be possible, you must not depend on being able to \"deselect\" already selected items.\nFortunately, both the quick algorithms mentioned at the end of point 2 do satisfy this requirement. In both cases, an item once selected will never be later rejected.\n\nThere is at least one use case for reservoir sampling which is still very much relevant: sampling a datastream which is too voluminous or too high-bandwidth to store. That might be some kind of massive social media feed, or it might be telemetry data from a large sensor array, or whatever. In that case, you might want to reduce the size of the datastream by extracting only a small sample, and reservoir sampling is a good candidate. However, that has nothing to do with the Postgres example.\n\n\nIn summary:\n\nYes, you can (and probably should) use Vitter's Algorithm Z in preference to Knuth's Algorithm S, even if you know how big the data set it.\n\nBut there are certainly better algorithms, some of which are outlined above.\n\n\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Is a Python list the same list as defined by my data structures and algorithms textbook?\r\n                \r\nI am reading a book about data structures and basic algorithms to get a better grasp on programming. The book I am reading defines some data structures, e.g. list, array, etc, and specifies the interfaces to these, and also how they can be implemented (or constructed) using existing data structures in different languages. For example, it discusses how a list can be constructed as an array or as linked cells.\n\nHowever, when I start looking at these data types in different languages I find that they do not always follow the interfaces that are defined in the book. \n\nFor example, the book says that in a list you should be able to step through the different elements one at the time, starting only at one of the ends. For example, if I want the third element, I would have to start with the first element and use a \"next\" operation until I get to the element I want. But lists in Python have integer indices and I can directly access any element directly by using the corresponding index. In the book, the index type only has to be an ordered type with a comparison operation for equality. (I think the book tries to stay general by abstracting things).\n\nDoes this mean that Python's lists are not lists in the \"true sense\"? Or is it that the data structures defined in the book are only suggestions on how the interfaces for these can look, and in practice there can be a lot of variation?\n\nI understand that the idea about the book is to get a better understanding for how to think about data structures, and to introduce some typical ones, so I am inclined to think that the latter answer is the correct one.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThere are multiple names for many data structures (hash[map/table]/dictionary/associative array comes to mind). You're referring to two data structures which are unrelated beyond the fact that they both store a linear sequence of items. The name similarity is an unfortunate source of confusion, but the TL;DR is that lists in Python's terminology are very similar to, and are built upon, arrays while linked lists, which your text refers to as \"lists\", aren't.\n\nIt's important to separate implementation from interface: the underlying data structure behind a queue, for example, could be an array or a linked list, but this should be an implementation detail that the client of the interface doesn't know or care about. The interface should enforce guarantees for the time complexity of various operations. It's common for data structure texts to implement abstract data types using various underlying \"primitive\" data structures like arrays or linked lists, many of which may impact the resulting complexity of various operations (prompting student analysis).\n\nLinked lists are simple, dynamic (expandible) data structures that offer fast O(1) add and removal operations on both ends. Their nodes may be doubly-linked and are usually structs or objects in memory with pointers or references to ```\nnext```\n and (if doubly-linked) ```\nprevious```\n elements as well as a ```\ndata```\n property per node. There is no random access for linked lists--you have to walk through the list from an endpoint to locate a single element by following the pointers.\n\nLinked lists are typically used to implement queues, stacks and more complex data structures like Java's ```\nLinkedHashMap```\n, which combines a doubly linked list and a hash map. Python offers ```\ncollections.deque```\n and ```\nQueue```\n which are linked list-based data structures offering fast access to front and back elements. Other libraries, like Java's ```\nArrayDeque```\n, use circular arrays to implement the same deque interface.\n\nTree nodes are a variant of singly linked list nodes with two child pointers rather than a single next pointer. As with linked lists (and their nodes), typically tree nodes and trees will be an implementation detail behind an interface such as the C++ ```\nmap```\n. You can implement trees with arrays, for example, as is typically the case with heaps.\n\nPython's lists (also known as ```\nArrayLists```\n (Java), arrays (JS/Ruby), vectors (C++/Haskell) and ```\nList```\n (C#)) are a dynamic abstraction on primitive arrays, which are fixed in size. The list abstraction adds a ```\nlength```\n property and many functions for manipulating the underlying array like ```\nappend```\n/```\npush```\n/```\npush_back```\n, ```\npop```\n, ```\nshift```\n, ```\nsplice```\n, etc (names are dependent on language). The underlying array will be automatically resized to fit the number of elements it contains. Inserting or removing elements at the front or middle of the list is an O(n) operation since as many as all elements need to be shifted to accommodate the adjustment to the array. This shifting is part of the abstraction and is hidden to the client.\n\nThe advantages of lists are the same as those of arrays: fast random access to any element. Additions to the end of a list are also fast and constant-time because the occasional reallocations of the underlying array are amortized across multiple append operations.\n\nAn important consideration for lists versus primitive arrays is the memory scheme. Python lists are comprised of objects and suffer from many of the problems of linked lists in that pointers to heap-allocated data need to be referenced and may have poor locality. Using a numpy array provides the advantages of a C array in that you get chunks of sequential memory which benefit from fast access (sweeping a memory-aligned offset over the data) and locality. Increased overhead is the typical cost of abstractions like lists and it can have a major performance impact on certain applications.\n\nTo add to the confusion, at least two high level languages, C++ and Haskell, have a \"list\" data structure, but these are actually linked lists rather than dynamic array(list)s.\n\nRegardless of the language you're using, it's important to distinguish what the data structures you're using really are (in terms of time complexity for typical operations, primarily) to avoid inadvertent misuse and select the correct tool for the job.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Descendent / Ancestor query\r\n                \r\nI already looked at my book many times, but I'm confused about one definition. In my data structures and algorithms book, I have the following definition:\n\nA node u is an ancestor of a node v if u = v or u is an ancestor of the parent of v. Conversely, we say that a node is a descendent of a node u if u is an ancestor of v.\n\nWhat is the first part of the definition saying?

And the ancestors of C's parent A are as well.\n\nSo we have to find all ancestors of A!\n\nWell, by the definition A is its own ancestor, and as it has no parent, it has no other ancestors.\n\nSo then, having reached a terminating condition, the recursion sends us back through the stack for the result ...\n\nC has the ancestors C (itself) and A (all the parent A's ancestors).\n\nE has the ancestors E (itself) and C, A (all the parent C's ancestors). \n\n*G has the ancestors G (itself) and E, C, A (all the parent E's ancestors).\n\nI hope this makes it more clear, but, as they say, \"In order to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.\"\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Time complexity for convex hull\r\n                \r\nGoing through a text book on Data structures and algorithms(Steven Skiena), I came across convex hull problem.\n\nSo, objective is to find convex hull for a given set of points.\nBooks says:\n```\nOnce you have the points sorted by x-coordinate, the points can be inserted from left to\nright into the hull. Since the right-most point is always on the boundary, we know that \nit must appear in the hull.

The total time is linear after the sorting has been done.\n```\n\nI am not able to understand how is this a linear time solution after sorting is done?\nEvery time we add a new point, we need to check for all exiting points whether they are inside polygon or not, which goes as 1,2,3,4,5...n operations. Adding these number of operations gives O(N*N).\nAm I missing something here?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nSince you're constructing a polygon, you don't just have a set of points as your output, you also know which points are neighbours of which other points.

The total number of checks is therefore at most n for the points you delete, plus at most 2n for the neighbours you don't delete.\nSo you do O(n) convexity checks, and each check takes O(1) time since you only need to consider three points; hence, except for the initial sorting, the rest of the algorithm takes linear time.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Intuitive explanation of binary tree traversals without recursion\r\n                \r\nI have seen many articles and books (and Stack Overflow answers) that show how to do preorder, inorder, and postorder depth-first tree traversals iteratively, using an explicit stack instead of recursion.\nFor example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first_search_2\n\nPreorder traversal is simple, but I think the others are complicated and far from obvious.\n\nIs there any source (preferably article or book) that explains these algorithms intuitively, so you can see how someone would have come up with them in the first place?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nHow to come up with an iterative solution without a stack\n\nA stack is not necessary to implement iterative tree traversals! You can get rid of any stacks whatsoever by keeping a parent pointer in the tree node data structure. This is how you come up with it:\n\nWhat is an iterative solution? An iterative solution is a solution where a fixed part of the code is repeatedly executed in a loop (pretty much the definitive of iteration).  The input to a loop is a state s1 of the system, the output is a state s2, and the loop takes the system from state s1 to state s2. You start with an initial state s, and you finish when you reach the final desired state s. \n\nSo our problem reduces to finding:\n\n\nA characterisation of the state of the system which helps us achieve this goal. The initial state will coincide with our initial conditions, and the terminal state will coincide with our desired result\nFinding the instructions that are executed repeatedly as part of the loop \n\n\n(This effectively turns the tree into a state machine.)\n\nIn tree traversals, at every step, a node is visited. Each node of the tree is visited at most thrice - once from the parent, once from the leftChild, and once from the right Child. What we do with the node at a particular step depends on which of the three cases it is. \n\nSo if we capture all this information: which node it is we are visiting, and which of the cases it is, we have a characterization of the system. \n\nA way to capture this information is to store a reference to a previous node/state:\n\n```\nNode current;\nNode previous;\n```\n\n\nIf previous = current.parent, then  we are visiting from the parent. If previous = current.leftChild, we are visiting from the left, and if  previous = current.rightChiild, we are visiting from the right.\n\nAnother way we can capture this information:\n\n```\nNode current; \nboolean visitedLeft;\nboolean visitedRight;\n```\n\n\nIf visitedLeft and visitedRight both are false, then we are visiting from the parent, if visitedLeft is true but visitedRight is false, we are visiting from the left, and if both visitedLeft and visitedRight are true, we are visiting from the right (the fourth state: visitedLeft false but visitedRight false, is never reached in preOrder).\n\nInitially, we start with viisitedLeft = false, visitedRight = false, and current = root. When the traversal is complete, we expect visitedLeft = true, visitedRight = true, and current = null. \n\nIn the instructions run repeated as part of the loop, the system has to move from one state to another. So in the instructions, we just tell the system what to do when it encounters any of the state, and when to end execution.\n\nYou can combine all three traversals in one function with:\n\n```\nvoid traversal(String typeOfTraversal){\n\n    boolean visitedLeft = false;\n    boolean visitedRight = false;\n    TreeNode currentNode = this.root;\n\n    while(true){\n\n        if (visitedLeft == false && currentNode.leftChild != null){\n            if(typeOfTraversal == \"preOrder\"){\n                System.out.println(currentNode.key);\n            }\n            currentNode = currentNode.leftChild;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (visitedLeft == false && currentNode.leftChild == null){\n            if(typeOfTraversal == \"preOrder\"){\n                System.out.println(currentNode.key);\n            }\n            visitedLeft = true;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (visitedLeft == true && visitedRight == false && currentNode.rightChild != null){\n            if(typeOfTraversal == \"inOrder\"){\n                System.out.println(currentNode.key);\n            }\n            currentNode = currentNode.rightChild;\n            visitedLeft = false;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (visitedLeft == true && visitedRight == false && currentNode.rightChild == null){\n            if(typeOfTraversal == \"inOrder\"){\n                System.out.println(currentNode.key);\n            }\n            visitedRight = true;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (visitedLeft == true && visitedRight == true && currentNode.parent != null){\n            if(typeOfTraversal == \"postOrder\"){\n                System.out.println(currentNode.key);\n            }\n\n            if (currentNode == currentNode.parent.leftChild){\n                visitedRight = false;\n            }\n            currentNode = currentNode.parent;\n        }\n\n        if (visitedLeft == true && visitedRight == true && currentNode.parent == null){       \n            if(typeOfTraversal == \"postOrder\"){\n                System.out.println(currentNode.key);\n            }\n            break; //Traversal is complete.\n        }\n```\n\n\nIf you are given node-level locks, this algorithm allows concurrent traversal and update of the tree. Any atomic operation other than detaching a non-leaf node is safe.\n\n\n\nHow to come up with a stack-based solution\n\nStacks are useful data structures when thinking of converting a recursive solution to an iterative one, or for coming up with an iterative solution to a problem defined recursively. A call stack, a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program, is how most high-level programming languages implement recursion below-the-hood. So using a stack explicitly in an iterative solution, we'd just be mimicking what the processor does when we write recursive code. Matt Timmermans's answer gives a good intuition as to why stacks are used and how to come up with an explicit stack based solution.\n\nI've written about how to come up with the postOrder solution with two stacks here: Understanding the logic in iterative Postorder traversal implementation on a Binary tree.\n\n\n\nThe parent-pointer based approach consumes more memory than a stack-based approach would. On a stack, the pointers to nodes still to be processed are transient and only require on the order of O(log n) stack space, because you only need to keep enough of them around for a single path down the tree (and in practice, this could be less). Storing the parent pointers with the nodes, in contrast, takes fixed O(n) space.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Because\nthey say that Insertion in an array takes place in one step, because\nthe data item is simply inserted at the first available position;\nand so insertion is faster than Search.\n\nBut actually it is two kinds of operations - one is visiting the\narray position(s), two is actually inserting the data item in that\nmemory location.\n\nI am curious in why don't they give much thought to the actual\ninsertion (or the comparison operation in the case of Search)\noperation (as it appears to me). I have never seen anyone discuss\nmuch about that operation when algorithms are discussed. \n\nIs it something about the computer memory that only visiting a\nmemory location is something to bother about, and the operation of\nactually putting the data item at the memory location not something\nmuch thought is given to? Doesn't it eat up the computer's\nresources? (I hope I have put this question clearly!)\nSecondly, (assuming that the array doesn't have duplicates) I have read that in the Search algorithm (I think it's about Linear Search), it takes an average of N/2 steps (step= a visit at an array position) to search the array if there is N number of data items in the array. My question is that how is this average value calculated.\n\n\nNote: I have just started reading Robert Lafore's \"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java\" book, and I am not sure what exactly should I read up on (computer memory?, how array items are placed in memory? confusion!) to make these things clear to me.

The OP says \"the data item is simply inserted at the first available position\", and in the case of arrays, the first available position is the one after the last item.

So, the item will simply be appended at the end of the array, and this is just a single write operation.  (If the point of insertion ```\ni```\n was to be in the middle of the array, then all subsequent items would have to be moved up by one position to make room for it, and that would be ```\n(N-i)```\n reads and another ```\n(N-i)```\n writes, in addition to the one write for storing the item at ```\ni```\n.)\nFor searching for an item, finding the average number of operations for a single search is the same as summing up the number of operations of all possible searches and dividing by the number of searches. Searching for the item at position 1 will take one operation, searching for the item at position 2 will take two operations, and searching for the item at position N will take N operations, so the formula is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N, which is known to be equal to N*(N+1)/2. Dividing by N this gives (N+1)/2, which is equivalent to N/2, because in these types of calculations we disregard constant factors.  (The '+1' is a constant factor.)  Note: all of this assumes not only that there are no duplicates, but also that each sought-for item ends up being found in the array, because searching for an item which is not in the array would result in a full array traversal which would take N operations.\n\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Within the context of room bookings, the \"greedy solution\" would be basically to start from the beginning of the period and always pick the booking with the latest end date.\n\nThe idea of course with this problem is that the each \"subinterval\" is a booking, so the fewer subintervals we need, the fewer bookings, and hence the fewer \"switches\" we need.\n\n\n\n1 I'm not actually 100% sure that this is the correct name, but if you were to say \"interval cover problem\", the listener would probably think of the same thing. \n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Algorithms for calculating the similarity of numerous documents (e.g. books of the Bible)\r\n                \r\nMy goal is to process the Bible in a way that enables calculating the relative similarity of any two books of the Bible. Ideally, two books should score higher if their word distributions are similar, but also if they have more phrases in common. For example, the book of Matthew borrows heavily from the book of Mark, but is about twice the length, and while numerous passages are duplicated verbatim, the order of the duplicated verses is not consistent.\n\nIt would be great if this could be done hierarchically; verses processed individually, aggregated into chapters and then finally books. Given a verse, it would be good to be able to retrieve a ranked list of similar verses and so on with chapters and books.\n\nIf the system could give partial credit for similar words (walk, walked, walking) that would also be good.\n\nOnce completed I would like to extend this to any set of documents.\n\nSo far, I am considering storing each word as an inverted index in a graph database, and then using graph algorithms to score the similarity of the graphs, but I don't know what algorithm to use for the scoring (Collaborative Filtering?).\n\nSomething like Levenstein Distance or BK-Trees may be helpful (for fuzzy matching) but seem inadequate for a total solution.

{"Question": "Drawing the repeated square diagram of Power(2,6) in a recursively\r\n                \r\nI am having a hard time understanding the process of drawing the repeated square diagram of recursion.\nI have the book of data structure and algorithms which shows this code on page 210:\n```\npublic static double power(double x, int n) {\n    if (n == 0)\n        return 1;\n    else {\n        double partial = power(x, n/2);    // rely on truncated division of n\n        double result = partial * partial;\n        if (n % 2 == 1)                    // if n odd, include extra factor of x\n            result *= x;\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd a recursion trace of ```\npower(2,13)```\n:\n\nBut it's not clear how they draw compute the square in each step.\nHow did they skip the exponentials and jumped to different numbers?\nI am not getting how they draw the above diagram and how the computing of the ```\npower(2,13)```\n is drawn.\nCan someone help me with the explanation of this concept? Examples are welcome.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe difference in numbers that you see in the recursion trace comes from ```\nn/2```\n in the code. It is an integer division by two. So 13/2 is 6 and 6/2 is 3 and 3/2 is 1, and finally 1/2 is 0. This is what you see when you read the diagram from top to bottom. The diagram shows these entries shifted more and more to the right to represent the depth of the recursion. The function calls itself, and then it calls itself again, ...etc. All of these calls are pending... Each time these calls pass a value for ```\nn```\n that is smaller (halved).\nSomewhere this stops. It needs to, of course. This stops when the value of ```\nn```\n receives the value 0. You see this state at the bottom of the diagram. At that moment, the recursion does not go deeper and starts to unwind, and you need to read the diagram now from bottom back to the top. For ```\nn```\n equal to 0, the return value is 1 (```\nreturn 1```\n).\nThis value is read by the function execution where ```\nn```\n is 1 and where the call ```\npower(2, 0)```\n was made and waiting for a return value. It receives 1 as result. This value is then squared (```\npartial * partial```\n) which in this case still is 1. And because ```\nn```\n is odd (it is 1 here), there is an additional multiplication ```\n*= x```\n. So we actually calculate ```\npartial * partial * x```\n, which is ```\n1 * 1 * 2```\n. You'll see this in the diagram.\nAnd this value (2) is returned to the function execution where ```\nn```\n is 3 and where the call ```\npower(2, 1)```\n was made. It receives 2 as result. This value is then squared (```\npartial * partial```\n) which in this case is 4. And because ```\nn```\n is odd (it is 3 here), there is an additional multiplication ```\n*= x```\n. So we actually calculate ```\npartial * partial * x```\n, which is ```\n2 * 2 * 2```\n. You'll see this in the diagram.\nI hope you see the pattern. The function executions that are pending for a result, all get their value back from the recursive function call they made, do some multiplication with it and return that, in turn, to their caller.\nAnd so the recursion backtracks to the top, providing the end result to the top-level call of ```\npower(2, 13)```\n.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

But if we use the very minimal code needed to do different tasks. Will there most often be differences in execution time due to the abstraction level of different languages?\n\nAnd also, does anyone know any good books about these kind of topic?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nFirst off, low-level vs. high-level is not a well-defined language attribute.  It tends to be used to refer to the accessibility of primitive machine capabilites, to the abstraction facilities the language provides, and again to describe the specific abstraction level of available libraries.  And while these aspects are arguably correlated, they are not dependably so -- none of them is required for another.\n\nLack of access to machine primitives naturally removes flexibility for general-purpose performance programming, but languages without such access can achieve high performance for particular domains by using libraries and/or runtimes that are specialized for that domain (e.g., NumPy and Matlab performance with linear algebra).\n\nPoor abstraction facilities make design, development, use, reuse, and maintenance harder.  This doesn't necessarily impact potential performance directly -- but practically speaking, efforts put into mechanics aren't being used to improve performance.  Likewise, lack of high-level libraries doesn't necessarily impact performance directly, but poorly-built re-implementations of essential facilities can have the same effect.\n\n\n\nSo, to answer your question:  in no aspect does language \"level\" generally determine performance.  But, there is always a \"but\"...\n\nAdditionally, there are costs to \"wide-spectrum\" languages such as C++, which combine access to primitive capabilities with good abstraction facilities and extensive libraries:  complexity and cognitive load, which (IMHO) are the drivers of the aforementioned correlation between the different aspects of language \"level\".\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Shortest path in JavaScript\r\n                \r\nI have been searching for weeks for a way to compute shortest paths in JavaScript. I have been playing with the book Data Structures and Algorithms by Groner (aptly named) at  https://github.com/loiane/javascript-datastructures-algorithms/tree/master/chapter09.\n\nThe trouble I keep on finding is that the code is so customized that it is almost impossible to rewrite to produce the desired results. I would like to be able to get the shortest path from any given vertex to any other, rather than, as Groner codes it, just the list of everything from A. I would like to be able to get, for example, the path from F to B, or from C to A. \n\nThe full code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/8cn7e2x8/\n\nCan anyone help?  \n\n```\nvar graph = new Graph();\nvar myVertices = ['A','B','C','D','E','F'];\nfor (var i=0; i<myVertices.length; i++) {\n    graph.addVertex(myVertices[i]);\n}\ngraph.addEdge('A', 'B');\ngraph.addEdge('B', 'C');\ngraph.addEdge('B', 'E');\ngraph.addEdge('C', 'D');\ngraph.addEdge('C', 'E');\ngraph.addEdge('C', 'G');\ngraph.addEdge('D', 'E');\ngraph.addEdge('E', 'F');\n\ngraph.dfs();\n\nconsole.log('********* sortest path - BFS ***********');\nvar shortestPathA = graph.BFS(myVertices[0]);\n\n//from A to all other vertices\nvar fromVertex = myVertices[0];\n\nfor (i = 1; i < myVertices.length; i++) {\n    var toVertex = myVertices[i],\n    path = new Stack();\n    for (var v = toVertex; v !== fromVertex; v = shortestPathA.predecessors[v]) {\n        path.push(v);\n    }\n    path.push(fromVertex);\n    var s = path.pop();\n    while (!path.isEmpty()) {\n        s += ' - ' + path.pop();\n    }\n    console.log(s);\n}\n```\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nLet us begin by remarking that breadth-first search (BFS) computes the shortest paths from a given source vertex if the graph is unweighted. In other words, we consider the length of a path to be the number of edges in the path.\nHere is an easy way to construct an unweighted graph:\n```\nfunction Graph() {\n  var neighbors = this.neighbors = {}; // Key = vertex, value = array of neighbors.\n\n  this.addEdge = function (u, v) {\n    if (neighbors[u] === undefined) {  // Add the edge u -> v.\n      neighbors[u] = [];\n    }\n    neighbors[u].push(v);\n    if (neighbors[v] === undefined) {  // Also add the edge v -> u so as\n      neighbors[v] = [];               // to implement an undirected graph.\n    }                                  // For a directed graph, delete\n    neighbors[v].push(u);              // these four lines.\n  };\n\n  return this;\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have implemented an undirected graph. As mentioned in the inline comments, you can modify the code to construct a directed graph by deleting four lines from the ```\naddEdge```\n function.\nThis implementation of BFS would work equally well on a directed graph:\n```\nfunction bfs(graph, source) {\n  var queue = [ { vertex: source, count: 0 } ],\n      visited = { [source]: true },\n      tail = 0;\n  while (tail < queue.length) {\n    var u = queue[tail].vertex,\n        count = queue[tail++].count;  // Pop a vertex off the queue.\n    print('distance from ' + source + ' to ' + u + ': ' + count);\n    graph.neighbors[u].forEach(function (v) {\n      if (!visited[v]) {\n        visited[v] = true;\n        queue.push({ vertex: v, count: count + 1 });\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo find the shortest path between two given vertices and display the vertices along the path, we have to remember the predecessor of each vertex as we explore the graph:\n```\nfunction shortestPath(graph, source, target) {\n  if (source == target) {   // Delete these four lines if\n    print(source);          // you want to look for a cycle\n    return;                 // when the source is equal to\n  }                         // the target.\n  var queue = [ source ],\n      visited = { [source]: true },\n      predecessor = {},\n      tail = 0;\n  while (tail < queue.length) {\n    var u = queue[tail++],  // Pop a vertex off the queue.\n        neighbors = graph.neighbors[u];\n    for (var i = 0; i < neighbors.length; ++i) {\n      var v = neighbors[i];\n      if (visited[v]) {\n        continue;\n      }\n      visited[v] = true;\n      if (v === target) {   // Check if the path is complete.\n        var path = [ v ];   // If so, backtrack through the path.\n        while (u !== source) {\n          path.push(u);\n          u = predecessor[u];          \n        }\n        path.push(u);\n        path.reverse();\n        print(path.join(' &rarr; '));\n        return;\n      }\n      predecessor[v] = u;\n      queue.push(v);\n    }\n  }\n  print('there is no path from ' + source + ' to ' + target);\n}\n```\n\nThe following snippet demonstrates these operations on the graph that you gave in your question.

It would be funny if a lot of these suggestions didn't ring so true.\nThe Programming Section of Wiki Books - suggested by Jim Robert as having a large amount of books/tutorials on multiple languages in various stages of completion\nJust the Basics To get a feel for a language.\n\nBooks\nCode Complete - This book goes without saying, it is truely brilliant in too many ways to mention.\nThe Pragmatic Programmer - The next best thing to working with a master coder, teaching you everything they know.\nMastering Regular Expressions - Regular Expressions are an essential tool in every programmer's toolbox.  This book, recommended by Patrick Lozzi is a great way to learn what they are capable of.\nAlgorithms in C, C++, and Java - A great way to learn all the classic algorithms if you find Knuth's books a bit too in depth.\n\nC\n\nOnline Tutorials\nThis tutorial seems to pretty consise and thourough, looked over the material and seems to be pretty good.  Not sure how friendly it would be to new programmers though.\nBooks\nK&R C - a classic for sure.  It might be argued that all programmers should read it.\nC Primer Plus - Suggested by Imran as being the ultimate C book for beginning programmers.\nC: A Reference Manual - A great reference recommended by Patrick Lozzi.\n\nC++\n\nOnline Tutorials\nThe tutorial on cplusplus.com seems to be the most complete.

And is it a problem to calculate this at runtime instead?\nIs there a better approach(or maybe an already written algorithm) for doing this?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nCalculate the number of sums you'll have from 1 <= page # <= N, where N is the number of pages.  It's far less than 10,000, because 1 and 10 and 100 and 1000 and 10000 all map to the sum 1.  The max value you'll have comes from 9999 => 36.  You can start with a map where the page # is the key and the sum is the value, then reverse it and have map where sum is the key and a list of pages whose numbers sum is equal to the key is the value.\n\nFor 10,000 pages, all possible sums fall between 1 and 36.\n\nSo if you choose a random number from some range, use that as the key into the reversed map to get the list of pages that map to that sum.  The length of that list divided by the number of pages is the probability you want.\n\nHere's how I'd do it:\n\n```\npackage misc;\n\nimport java.util.*;\n\n/**\n * PageSumProbability\n *\n * @author Michael\n * @since 10/14/11\n */\npublic class PageSumProbability {\n\n    private Map<Integer, Integer> pageNumberSum;\n    private Map<Integer, List<Integer>> sumPageNumbers;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        if (args.length > 1) {\n            int maxPageNumber = Integer.valueOf(args[0]);            \n            int randomSum = Integer.valueOf(args[1]);\n            PageSumProbability psp = new PageSumProbability(maxPageNumber);\n            System.out.println(psp.getPageNumberSum());\n            System.out.println(psp.getSumPageNumbers());\n            System.out.printf(\"random sum: %d probability of opening page # that equals random sum: %5.3f%%\\n\",\n                    randomSum, 100*psp.getProbabilityOfSum(randomSum));\n        } else {\n            System.out.print(\"Usage: PageProbabilitySum <# pages> <random sum>\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public PageSumProbability(int maxPageNumber) {\n        this.pageNumberSum = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();\n        this.sumPageNumbers = new TreeMap<Integer, List<Integer>>();\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= maxPageNumber; ++i) {\n            int sum = this.calculateSumOfDigits(i);\n            this.pageNumberSum.put(i, sum);\n            List<Integer> pages = this.sumPageNumbers.get(sum);\n            if (pages == null) {\n                pages = new LinkedList<Integer>();\n            }\n            pages.add(i);\n            this.sumPageNumbers.put(sum, pages);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static int calculateSumOfDigits(int pageNumber) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        String pageNumberAsString = String.valueOf(Math.abs(pageNumber));\n        for (int i = 0; i < pageNumberAsString.length(); ++i) {\n            StringBuilder digit = new StringBuilder();\n            digit.append(pageNumberAsString.charAt(i));\n            sum += Integer.valueOf(digit.toString());\n        }\n\n        return sum;\n    }\n\n    public double getProbabilityOfSum(int randomSum) {\n        if (randomSum <= 0)\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"random sum must be greater than zero\");\n        double probability = 0.0;\n        List<Integer> pages = this.sumPageNumbers.get(randomSum);\n        if (pages != null) {\n            probability = (double) pages.size()/this.pageNumberSum.size();\n        }\n\n        return probability;\n    }\n\n    public Map<Integer, Integer> getPageNumberSum() {\n        return Collections.unmodifiableMap(this.pageNumberSum);\n    }\n\n    public Map<Integer, List<Integer>> getSumPageNumbers() {\n        return Collections.unmodifiableMap(this.sumPageNumbers);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

You need to learn some methods of reducing the size of your problem for presentation to SO (or to Tech Support).\n\nOne of the first steps in C or C++ is to ensure that the headers you create compile cleanly.  If the headers aren't clean, you won't be able to compile the code that uses the headers, so headers must be sorted out first.\n\nTo help me, I have a script that I call ```\nchkhdr```\n:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n# Check whether headers compile\n\ntmp=chkhdr-$$\ntrap 'rm -f $tmp.?; exit 1' 0 1 2 3  13 15\n\ncat > $tmp.c <<EOF\n#include HEADER /* Check self-containment */\n#include HEADER /* Check idempotence */\nint main(void) { return 0; }\nEOF\n\noptions=\nfor file in \"$@\"\ndo\n    case \"$file\" in\n    (-*) options=\"$options $file\";;\n    (*)  echo \"$file\"\n         ${CC:-gcc} $options -DHEADER=\"\\\"$file\\\"\" -c $tmp.c\n         ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nrm -f $tmp.?\ntrap 0\n```\n\n\nI use it to check that headers are both self-contained and idempotent.  A self-contained header can be included without any other headers before it, and it compiles.  That means it can be used anywhere its services are needed without further ado.  An idempotent header can be included multiple times without causing trouble.  (I mainly work in C, hence the default compiler is GCC rather than G++.  But I can set ```\nCC=g++```\n in the environment to switch to C++ work.)\n\nYour ```\nstudent.h```\n header was not idempotent; I immediately added the standard stanzas at top and bottom:\n\n```\n#ifndef STUDENT_H_INCLUDED\n#define STUDENT_H_INCLUDED\n\n...original contents of student.h...\n\n#endif /* STUDENT_H_INCLUDED */\n```\n\n\nThe detailed choice of guard macro name is up to you; that's the naming scheme I use these days, but there's some merit in using something like an MD5 checksum of an draft of the header to give you a quasi-random guard macro.\n\nThe output from compiling the ```\nstudent.h```\n header alone was:\n\n```\nIn file included from chkhdr-8120.c:1:\n/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/bits/ios_base.h: In copy constructor ‘std::basic_ios<char, std::char_traits<char> >::basic_ios(const std::basic_ios<char, std::char_traits<char> >&)’:\n/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/bits/ios_base.h:779: error: ‘std::ios_base::ios_base(const std::ios_base&)’ is private\n/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/iosfwd:55: error: within this context\n/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/iosfwd: In copy constructor ‘std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >::basic_ostream(const std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >&)’:\n/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/iosfwd:64: note: synthesized method ‘std::basic_ios<char, std::char_traits<char> >::basic_ios(const std::basic_ios<char, std::char_traits<char> >&)’ first required here \nstudent.h: In function ‘std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, Student&)’:\nstudent.h:20: note: synthesized method ‘std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >::basic_ostream(const std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char> >&)’ first required here \nstudent.h:20: error:   initializing argument 1 of ‘std::ostream& Student::writeLegibly(std::ostream)’\n```\n\n\nThe last line of the error message points firmly at the issue; the other messages are somewhat tangential, and lead up to the crux message.  (Very often, especially in C, the first error is the most significant.  It was surprising to me that the last line was the key one.)  Changing line 20 of ```\nstudent.h```\n to read:\n\n```\n    ostream& writeLegibly(ostream&);\n```\n\n\nresolved that problem, and the ```\nstudent.h```\n header compiled cleanly.  The other headers were also clean.  Then it was a simple matter to compile the source files.  Only ```\nstudent.cpp```\n had an issue:\n\n```\nstudent.cpp: In member function ‘std::istream& Student::readFromConsole(std::istream&)’:\nstudent.cpp:34: error: ‘cout’ was not declared in this scope\n```\n\n\nIt sounds like a case of 'should use ```\nstd::cout```\n instead', but adding that leads to:\n\n```\nstudent.cpp: In member function ‘std::istream& Student::readFromConsole(std::istream&)’:\nstudent.cpp:34: error: ‘cout’ is not a member of ‘std’\n```\n\n\nThat is fixed by including ```\n#include <iostream>```\n.  Then the code compiles cleanly under:\n\n```\ng++ -c *.cpp\n```\n\n\nI can't link; I run into undefined references to the Database code, but that's not surprising.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe details of the fixes are not incredibly important.  What is important is the techniques.  The key techniques here are:\n\n\nEnsure headers work cleanly on their own (```\nchkhdr```\n).\nTackle one file at a time.\nProblem minimization.\n\n\nWe should not have had to deal with all the code; you should have been able to isolate the problems much better.  This is an important skill in any situation where you're reporting software problems to others.  Eliminate the extraneous, and reduce to bare essentials.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "About time complexity of arraylist and linkedlist\r\n                \r\nIn page 290 of the book data structures and algorithms it is mentioned that complexity of remove(i) for arraylist is O(1). My first question is why not O(n)? It is also mentioned add(i,e) for linked list is O(n), so my second question is why not O(min(i,n-i))?\n\nFinally, my 3rd question is the reason the complexity is mentioned as O(min(i,n-i)) is it due to being a doubly linked list, meaning we could either traverse from beginning (i) or end (n-i)?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe first one is debatable. When you remove the last element in an ArrayList, it's constant, but for a middle element, you need to shift all successor elements to the left. Java does that using System.arrayCopy(), a very fast native routine for copying arrays, but even that method is clearly O(n), not constant, so I'm inclined to agree with you. It's different for an insert, where the amortized cost of resizing arrays up to the required index is averaged out to a constant factor, so add() is O(1).\n\nThe second one could be implemented that way, but it isn't.

The worst case time complexity occurs when the tree is the most inbalanced it can be. We're working with heaps here – heaps are complete binary trees.

Well in general, a tree with m leaf nodes must have m - 1 internal nodes. Imagine if these m leaf nodes represented players in a tournament, if one player is eliminated per game, there must be m - 1 games to determine the winner. Each game corresponds to an internal node. Hence there are m - 1 internal nodes.\n\nBecause the tree is complete, the right subtree must also have m - 1 nodes.\n\n```\n          -------*-------\n         /                \\\n        *                  *\n       / \\                / \\\n      /   \\              /   \\\n     / m-1 \\            / m-1 \\\n    /-------\\          /-------\\\n   /--- m ---\\  \n```\n\n\nHence we have total number of nodes (including the root):\n\n```\nn = 1 + [(m - 1) + m] + (m - 1)\n  = 3m - 1\n```\n\n\nLet x = number of nodes in the left subtree. Then:\n\n```\nx = (m - 1) + m\n  = 2m - 1\n```\n\n\nWe can solve these simultaneous equations, eliminating variable m:\n\n```\n2n - 3x = 1\n      x = (2n - 1) / 3\n```\n\n\nHence x is less than 2n/3.

If you try to bundle them with binary somehow those would exceed ```\n10kb```\n limit hence you need to compress information somehow.\n\nI would go for ```\nNaive Bayes```\n classifier by default for a simple solution .\n\nDue to time constraint I would go a little bit different route though.\n\nData preparation\n\nRead all files in and tokenize them. Would be easiest with Python's ```\nsplit```\n functionality (and whole program would be easiest, time constraint probably won't be a problem). Split on whitespace and punctuation as those are mostly noise and are not representative of texts.\n\nNow calculate how often each of the tokens (words) occurs in each text, e.g. ```\ndog```\n occured ```\n15```\n times in first text and ```\n3```\n times in another. Save those in three separate dictionaries, if the size of ```\ndict```\n exceeds ```\n10kb```\n remove words occurring least frequently and adjust accordingly.\n\nClassifier for test phase\n\nUse ```\n3 unsigned long```\n variables to keep results for each texts to keep overflow in check (it should be enough).\n\nFor every input text split it just like above.\n\nFor every word check in dictionaries how often those occured for each text and add this to one of ```\n3```\n result variables. If it doesn't exist just add ```\n0```\n.\n\nFinally return text which gathered \"most points\" this way. This should get quite a good score.\n\nBetter solution\n\nNaive Bayes with probabilities would work much better but given competition constraints I don't think it is a viable solution.\n\nTo do it, you would have to calculate probability of each word for each text and use ```\nlog```\n operstions during summation to avoid aforementioned overflow, just throwing it out for you to consider, doable but probably overkill.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

We show\na simple class in Code Fragment 1.2 that defines a number of base types as local\nvariables for the main method.\" - form the book\n\nand then in the example code:\n\n```\nlong l = 890L;\n```\n\n\nmy question is why do I need to put a L in the end if the type of l(variable) is already declared as long?\n\nfor example if I do:\n\n```\nlong l = 890;\n```\n\n\nit still works so why in the example code its written as long l = 890L;\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThere is a distinction between the types of the variables and the types of the literals.\n\nIn this case:\n\n```\nlong l = 890L;\n```\n\n\nYou have a variable of type long and a literal of type long.  Naturally this works.\n\nIn this case:\n\n```\nlong l = 890;\n```\n\n\nYou have a variable of type long and a literal of type int.  The integer is automatically promoted to a long (because it will fit) and this works too.

{"Question": "Speed of two algorithms rotating a sequence. (from the book Programming Pearls)\r\n                \r\nIn Column 2 of the book Programming Pearls there is a problem asking you to design an algorithm to rotate a string k positions to the left. For example, the string is \"12345\" and k=2, then the result is \"34512\".\n\nThe first algorithm is to simulate the exchanging process, i.e. put x[(i + k) % n] into x[i], and repeat until finishing.\n\nThe second algorithm uses the observation that we only need to exchange the a=\"12\" and b=\"345\", i.e. first k characters and last n - k characters. We could reverse a to a'=\"21\", and b to b'=\"543' at first, then reverse (a'b')' to ba, which is desired.\n\nFollowing is my code:\n\nAlgorithm 1:\n\n```\n#define NEXT(j) ((j + k) % n)\n#define PREV(j) ((j + n - k) % n)\n\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n#include \"stdlib.h\"\n\nint gcd(int a, int b) {\n    return (a % b == 0 ? b : gcd(b, a % b));\n}\n\nvoid solve(int *a, int n, int k) {\n    int len = gcd(n, k);\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        int x = a[i];\n        int j = i;\n        do {\n            a[j] = a[NEXT(j)];\n            j = NEXT(j);\n        } while (j != i);\n        a[PREV(j)] = x;\n    }\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[])\n{\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\n    int *a = malloc(sizeof(int) * n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = i;\n\n    solve(a, n, k);\n\n    free(a);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n\nAlgorithm 2:\n\n```\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n#include \"stdlib.h\"\n\nvoid swap(int *a, int *b) {\n    int t = *a;\n    *a = *b;\n    *b = t;\n}\n\nvoid reverse(int *a, int n) {\n    int m = n / 2;\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        swap(a + i, a + (n - 1 - i));\n    }\n}\n\nvoid solve(int *a, int n, int k) {\n    reverse(a, k);\n    reverse(a + k, n - k);\n    reverse(a, n);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char const *argv[])\n{\n    int n, k;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\n    int *a = malloc(sizeof(int) * n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = i;\n\n    solve(a, n, k);\n\n    free(a);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n\nwhere n is the length of the string, and k is the length to rotate.\n\nI use n=232830359 and k=80829 to test the two algorithms. The result is, algorithm 1 takes 6.199s while algorithm 2 takes 1.970s.\n\nHowever, I think the two algorithms both need to compute n exchanges. (Algorithm 1 is obvious, algorithm 2 takes k/2 + (n-k)/2 + n/2 = n exchanges).\n\nMy question is, why their speeds differ so much?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nBoth of this algorithms are more memory bound than CPU bound. That's why it the case when analyzing the number of basic operations(like swaps or loop iterations) gives results that are quite different from the real running time. So we will use external memory model instead of RAM model. That is, we will analyze the number of cache misses. Let's assume that ```\nN```\n is an array size, ```\nM```\n is the number of blocks in cache and ```\nB```\n is one block size. As long as ```\nN```\n is big in your test, it safe to assume that ```\nN```\n >```\nM```\n(that is, all the array cannot be in cache).\n\n1)The first algorithm: It accesses array elements in the the following manner ```\ni```\n, ```\n(i + k) mod N```\n, ```\n(i + 2 * k) mod N```\n and so on. If ```\nk```\n is large, then two consecutively accessed elements are not in the same block. So in the worst case two accesses yield two cache misses.\nThese two blocks will be loaded into cache, but they might not be used for a long time after that! So when they are accessed again, they might be already replaced by other blocks(because the cache is smaller then the array). And it will be a miss again. It can be shown that this algorithm can have ```\nO(N)```\n cache misses in the worst case.\n\n2)The second algorithm has very different array access pattern: ```\nl, r, l + 1, r - 1, ...```\n.\nIf accessing the ```\nl```\n-th element causes a miss, the entire block with it is loaded into the cache, so accesses to ```\nl + 1```\n, ```\nl + 2```\n, ... till the end of the block will not cause any misses. The same is true for ```\nr```\n, ```\nr - 1```\n and so on(it is actually true only if ```\nl```\n and ```\nr```\n blocks can be held in cache at the same time, but this is a safe assumption because caches are usually not direct mapped). So this algorithm has ```\nO(N / B)```\n cache misses in the worst case.\n\nTaking into account that a block size of real cache is larger than one integer size, it becomes clear why the second algorithm is significantly faster.\n\nP.S It is just a model of what's really going on, but in this particular case external memory model works better than RAM model(and RAM model is just a model too, anyway).\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

From the for loops, we know that ```\nelem```\n is always either ```\nself.left```\n or ```\nself.right```\n. You can see in the example usage that float values are inserted into the binary tree with ```\ntree.insert(float(x))```\n and the ```\nBinarySearchTree.insert()```\n method ultimately calls ```\nBinarySearchTree.Node(val)```\n where ```\nval```\n is ```\nfloat(x)```\n in this case. Therefore ```\nself.left```\n and ```\nself.right```\n are always ```\nNode```\n instances.\n\nAs mentioned by don't talk just code in the comments, ```\nelem```\n is a float. I did not see this before because I assumed that iterating over ```\nself.left```\n would product a list of ```\nNode```\n elements. However this is not correct. In fact, iterating over ```\nself.left```\n works in this case by calling ```\nself.left.__iter__()```\n. I break down this ```\n__iter__()```\n function into 3 cases, almost like a recursive function. (It is not in fact recursive because it is calling the ```\n__iter__()```\n method of different instances of the ```\nNode```\n class, but its behavior is similar.)\n\nFirst, the Node has no ```\nleft```\n or ```\nright```\n children. This is straightforward: the iter will just yield ```\nself.val```\n, which is a float.\nSecond, the Node has ```\nleft```\n children. In this case, the for loop will  traverse down all the left children in an almost recursive fashion until it reaches a Node that has no ```\nleft```\n children. Then we are back at the first case.\nThird, the Node has ```\nright```\n children. In this case, after the own nodes ```\nself.val```\n is return, the iterator will continue to the first ```\nright```\n node, and repeat.\n\n\nThere is only one generator, namely ```\nNode.__iter__()```\n, because generators are functions. It uses multiple ```\nyield```\n statements to return different values depending on the situation. ```\nyield elem```\n and ```\nyield self.val```\n just return either a ```\nNode```\n if the current Node has left or right branches or the current Node's value.\n\nI do not have specific tips for debugging ```\nyield```\n statements in particular.

{"Question": "Coding mathematical algorithms - should I use variables in the book or more descriptive ones?\r\n                \r\nI'm maintaining code for a mathematical algorithm that came from a book, with references in the comments.  Is it better to have variable names that are descriptive of what the variables represent, or should the variables match what is in the book?  \n\nFor a simple example, I may see this code, which reflects the variable in the book.\n\n```\nA_c = v*v/r\n```\n\n\nI could rewrite it as \n\n```\ncentripetal_acceleration = velocity*velocity/radius\n```\n\n\nThe advantage of the latter is that anyone looking at the code could understand it.

Start with design patterns, which will help you reduce the amount messy code you produce, and understand better code made by other people (particularly libraries written with design patterns in mind).\n\nIn addition to the book of four, there are many other design pattern books -- Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, for example. It might be worth looking at them after you get a good grounding. But I also highly recommend Domain Driven Design, which I think gives you a way of thinking about how to structure your program, instead of just identifying pieces here and there.\n\nNext you can go with algorithms. I prefer Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual, whose emphasis is more on getting people to know how to select and use algorithms, as well as building them from well known \"parts\" than on getting people to know to make proofs about algorithms. It is also available for Kindle, which was useful to me.\n\nAlso, get a good data structures book -- people often neglect that. I like the Handbook of Data Structures and Applications, though I'm also looking into Advanced Data Structures.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend either TopCoder or Euler for this task. TopCoder is, imho, mostly about writing code fast. Nothing bad about it, but it's hardly likely to make a difference on day-to-day stuff. If you like it, by all means do it. Also, it's excellent preparation for job interviews with the more technically minded companies.\n\nProject Euler, on the other hand, is much more targeted at scientific computing, computer science and functional programming. It will be an excellent training ground when learning functional programming.\n\nThere's something that has a bit of design patterns, algorithms and functional programming, which is Elements of Programming. It uses C++ for its examples, which is a plus for you.\n\nAs for functional programming, I think it is less urgent than the other two. However, I indicate either Clojure or Haskell instead of Scala.\n\nLearning functional programming in Scala is like learning Spanish in a latino neighborhood, while learning functional programming in Clojure is like learning Spanish in Madrid, and learning functional programming in Haskell is like learning Spanish in an isolated monastery in Spain. :-)\n\nMind you, I prefer Scala as a programming language, but I already knew FP when I came to it.\n\nWhen you do get to functional programming, get Chris Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures, for a good grounding on algorithms and data structures for functional programming.\n\nBeyond that, try to learn a new language every year.

Even if the situation a'!=a* don't happen very often, but once it happens, the meaning of eligibility trace will totally lose, then the Q will not be updated again, since all the e(s,a)=0, then in every update, the e(s,a) will still be 0 if using the replacing traces.\n\nSo, is this an error here?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe idea of eligibility traces is to give credit or blame only to the eligible state-action pairs. The book from Sutton & Barto has a nice illustration of the idea:\nBackward view of eligibility traces\n\nIn Watkin's Q(λ) algorithm you want to give credit/blame to the state-action pairs you actually would have visited, if you would have followed your policy Q in a deterministic way (always choosing the best action).\n\nSo the answer to your question is in line 5:\n\n```\nChoose a' from s' using policy derived from Q (e.g. epsilon-greedy)```\n\n\nBecause a' is chosen epsilon greedy, there is a little chance (with probability epsilon) that you take an exploratory random step instead of a greedy step. In such a case the whole eligibility trace is set to zero, because it makes no sense to give credit/blame to state-action pairs that have been visited before. The state-action pairs you visited before the random exploratory step deserve no credit/blame for future rewards, hence you delete the whole eligibility trace. In the time steps afterwards you begin to build up a new eligibility trace...\n\nHope that helped.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

The formulas are :\n\n```\nSn= (I+n)/n```\n\n\nand \n\n```\nUn= E/(n+1)```\n\n\nwhere\n\n```\nSn= number of comparisons in case of successful search```\n\n\n```\nUn= number of comparisons in case of unsuccessful search```\n\n\n```\nI= internal path length of the binary tree, and```\n\n\n```\nE= external path length of the binary tree.```\n\n\n```\nn is the number of nodes in the binary tree.```\n\n\nHere i want to state that I do know how to get the comparisons in both the cases when an actual binary search case is given by making the binary search tree for it as explained here\n\nBut after explaining it with the binary tree they have also simply stated the formula to get a general representation of it. \nthe first formula for ```\nSn```\n I completely understood but the formula for ```\nUn```\n is just not clear to me. \n    ", "Answer": "\r\nIt is because the average number of comparisons for unsuccessful search is equal to the 'average external path length' of the tree which is given by the expression E/(n+1) , since there are (n+1) external nodes which represent all the fail cases.\n\nYou are comparing it with the average successful case which is causing you the confusion. In the case of successful search number of comparisons is equal to the number of nodes in the path from the root node to that success node. But unsuccessful search can be understood as the insertion of that particular node in the tree. ie: insertion of an element is equivalent to the unsuccessful search for that node. And  we know that the number of comparisons to find a node in the tree is exactly 1 more than the number of comparisons needed to insert it.\n\nFor example:\nconsider the sorted array: 3,7,10,13,15\n\nits binary search can be represented by the following binary search tree:\n\n```\n                             10\n                            /  \\\n                           /    \\\n                          /      \\\n                         3       13\n                        / \\     /  \\\n                        F  7   F   15\n                          / \\      / \\\n                         F   F    F   F\n```\n\n\nwhere F denotes the fail cases.\n\nNow this shows that if you search for 10 in this array it will take just one comparison, if you search for 3 or 13 both will take 2 comparisons each, similarly if u search for 7 or 15 it will take 3 comparisons each.\n\nInternal path length gives the number of edges from root to a particular internal node so for each node it will be one less than the number of comparisons required to successfully search for that node. Hence we add 1 for each node to the internal path length which leads to a total of n (since there are n internal nodes) so the formula (I+n)/n is justified.\n\nNow coming to the case of unsuccessful search, suppose in this example array you want to search for 2 (which is not present in the array) so the first comparison will be made with the mid element ie 10 , then second comparison with 3 and since the search cannot go lower than 3 our search ends here with only 2 comparisons, unlike what u stated that it would take 3 comparisons since it is on level 2 of the tree. Similarly while searching for 5 in this array you will have to make 3 comparisons and not 4. Hence we see that each fail node requires comparisons equal to its path length. And so we don not have to add an extra 1 for each external node and the average comparisons for unsuccessful search is equal to the average external path length of the binary tree. which justifies the formula E/(n+1).\n\nI guess this should clear your doubt of why we didnt add an extra 1 for each node.\n\ncheers!\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

My professor just said we should look at this stuff in the book because these questions will be similar to what are on our exams. I have no idea how to attack these problems. Please explain. I'm not looking for just a solution to copy down, but rather understanding.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nf(n) = O(g(n)) means there are positive constants c and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ k. https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bigOnotation.html\nis a definition. \nHere is a sketch of where to go with that and what it means without doing these problems for you. [I am deliberately leaving parts for you to figure out.]\nSo if we are saying 9n+77=O(n) that mean there is a constant c such that for n big enough 9n+77<=Cn. The intuition here is that in the grand scheme of things 77 does not matter and 9n is basically what matters, and that is a multiple of n. But choosing the constant = 9 will not do because 9n+77 is actually > 9n always. I feel like anything bigger than 9 would do, but let us keep life simple and choose C=10. So we want 9n+77<=10n. Solve that and you will have your k that n must be >= to.\n11n^2 + 75n + 84 = O(n^2) is intuitively true because in the long run the 11n^2 dwarfs everything else. Again, you would be tempted to pick C=11, but that will not quite do (why?). So you choose a bigger C and use it to say we want 11n^2+75n+84<=Cn^2. To find k, solve the inequality (choosing the part that looks like n>=the larger root of the corresponding quadratic equation). You may need to use the quadratic formula.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Just say\n\n```\nmid = list.length / 2\n```\n\n\nInteger division in Ruby truncates, so the result is always the integer you want. \n\nThe second recursive call is a problem. It can return nil. So you need to save the return value and only do the index arithmetic if it's not nil.\n\nFinally note that since Ruby naturally returns the last value it computes, all your ```\nreturn```\ns can be omitted. This makes the function read as an expression, which is more Ruby-like.\n\n```\ndef recursive_binary_search(list, item)\n  if list.length == 0\n    nil\n  elsif list.length == 1\n    if list.first == item\n      0\n    else\n      nil\n    end\n  else\n    mid = list.length / 2\n    guess = list[mid]\n    if guess == item\n      mid\n    elsif guess < item\n      result = recursive_binary_search(list[mid+1..-1], item)\n      if result.nil?\n        nil\n      else\n        1 + result + mid\n      end\n    else\n      recursive_binary_search(list[0..mid-1], item)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\nThe only case where ```\nreturn```\n is needed is to exit a function immediately when more computation is possible.\n\nFinally note that though this is great for learning, in a real implementation you'd avoid tail recursion in Ruby because, unlike some other languages, Ruby is not guaranteed to optimize it as a loop.

Any ideas? \n\n\nPlease, see exception log below:\n\n```\n15/05/29 18:24:05 WARN util.Utils: Your hostname, localhost.localdomain resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.0.1; using 10.0.2.15 instead (on interface eth0)\n15/05/29 18:24:05 WARN util.Utils: Set SPARK_LOCAL_IP if you need to bind to another address\n15/05/29 18:24:09 INFO slf4j.Slf4jLogger: Slf4jLogger started\n15/05/29 18:24:10 INFO Remoting: Starting remoting\n15/05/29 18:24:10 INFO Remoting: Remoting started; listening on addresses :[akka.tcp://sparkDriver@10.0.2.15:38910]\n15/05/29 18:24:10 INFO Remoting: Remoting now listens on addresses: [akka.tcp://sparkDriver@10.0.2.15:38910]\n15/05/29 18:24:12 ERROR executor.Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 6.0 (TID 4)\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.filter(RDD.scala:282)\n    at Small$$anonfun$4$$anonfun$apply$1.apply(Small.scala:58)\n    at Small$$anonfun$4$$anonfun$apply$1.apply(Small.scala:54)\n    at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:244)\n    at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:244)\n    at scala.collection.immutable.List.foreach(List.scala:318)\n    at scala.collection.TraversableLike$class.map(TraversableLike.scala:244)\n    at scala.collection.AbstractTraversable.map(Traversable.scala:105)\n    at Small$$anonfun$4.apply(Small.scala:54)\n    at Small$$anonfun$4.apply(Small.scala:51)\n    at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.next(Iterator.scala:328)\n    at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$13.hasNext(Iterator.scala:371)\n    at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.hasNext(Iterator.scala:327)\n    at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$13.hasNext(Iterator.scala:371)\n    at org.apache.spark.util.collection.ExternalAppendOnlyMap.insertAll(ExternalAppendOnlyMap.scala:137)\n    at org.apache.spark.Aggregator.combineValuesByKey(Aggregator.scala:58)\n    at org.apache.spark.shuffle.hash.HashShuffleWriter.write(HashShuffleWriter.scala:55)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask.runTask(ShuffleMapTask.scala:68)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask.runTask(ShuffleMapTask.scala:41)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:54)\n    at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:177)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:744)\n```\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nThis code:\n\n```\nval df = sc.parallelize(Array((1,30),(2,10),(3,20),(1,10)(2,30))).toDF(\"books\",\"readers\")\nval results = df.join(\ndf.select($\"books\" as \"r_books\", $\"readers\" as \"r_readers\"), \n$\"readers\" === $\"r_readers\" and $\"books\" < $\"r_books\"\n)\n.groupBy($\"books\", $\"r_books\")\n.agg($\"books\", $\"r_books\", count($\"readers\"))\n```\n\n\nGives the following result:\n\n```\nbooks r_books COUNT(readers)\n1     2       2     \n```\n\n\nSo ```\nCOUNT```\n here is a number of times two books (here 1 and 2) were read together (count of pairs).  \n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThis kind of thing is a lot easier if you convert the original RDD to a DataFrame:\n\n```\nval df = sc.parallelize(\n  Array((1,30),(2,10),(3,20),(1,10), (2,30))\n).toDF(\"books\",\"readers\")\n```\n\n\nOnce you do that, just do a self-join on the DataFrame to make book pairs, then count how many readers have read each book pair:\n\n```\nval results = df.join(\n  df.select($\"books\" as \"r_books\", $\"readers\" as \"r_readers\"), \n  $\"readers\" === $\"r_readers\" and $\"books\" < $\"r_books\"\n).groupBy(\n  $\"books\", $\"r_books\"\n).agg(\n  $\"books\", $\"r_books\", count($\"readers\")\n)\n```\n\n\nAs for additional explanation about that join, note that I am joining ```\ndf```\n back onto itself -- a self-join: ```\ndf.join(df.select(...), ...)```\n.

{"Question": "How to define what is the elementary operation in an algorithm?\r\n                \r\nI always thought that the elementary operation from an algorithm was the operation located inside the most inner loop.

{"Question": "Why is there no n-step Q-learning algorithm in Sutton's RL book?\r\n                \r\nI think I am messing something up.  \n\nI always thought that:\n- 1-step TD on-policy = Sarsa\n- 1-step TD off-policy = Q-learning\n\nThus I conclude:\n- n-step TD on-policy = n-step Sarsa\n- n-step TD off-policy = n-step Q-learning \n\nIn Sutton's book, however, he never introduces n-step Q-Learning, but he does introduce n-step off-policy Sarsa.

Q-learning is a version of off-policy 1-step temporal-difference learning, but not just that; it's specifically updating Q-values for the policy that is greedy with respect to current estimates. Off-policy value learning can be more general, it can be about learning for any target policy; Q-learning is more specific, it's specifically about having the greedy policy as target policy.\n\nA naive extension of Q-learning to ```\nn```\n steps would no longer be correct, because that doesn't work for off-policy algorithms (like Q-learning). You'd have to correct for the \"off-policyness\" in some way; one way to do that is importance sampling. When you introduce that in a more general manner (for any possible target policy), you get the algorithm on that page you mentioned, which they refer to there as Off-policy ```\nn```\n-step Sarsa. I suppose that a specific instance of this algorithm, with the target policy ```\npi```\n being the greedy policy with respect to ```\nQ```\n, could intuitively be understood as a \"correct\" version of ```\nn```\n-step Q-learning.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Can't access to Iterator from derived class\r\n                \r\nIn summary, my problem is that I want to find a way to get an access to the element to which iterator is pointing from a derived class. The details are at the below.\n\nI am implementing a sequence with a doubly linked list, referring to the book \"Data Structures & Algorithms in C++\" (written by Goodrich, Tamassia, Mount), page 255. The book defines class NodeSequence as a derived class of doubly linked list.\n\nHere is the code. Firstly, I made a doubly linked list class with struct Node and class Iterator inside. (This is saved as \"DList.h\")\n\n```\ntypedef int E;\n\nclass DList {\nprivate:\nstruct Node {\n    E element;\n    Node* prev;\n    Node* next;\n};\n\npublic:\n    class Iterator {\n    public:\n        E& operator*();//reference to the element\n        bool operator==(const Iterator& p) const;\n        bool operator!=(const Iterator& p) const;\n        Iterator& operator++();\n        Iterator& operator--();\n        friend class DList; //gives access to the DList\n    private:\n        Node* v; //pointer to the node\n        Iterator(Node* u); //create from Node\n};\n\npublic:\n    DList();\n    int size() const;\n    bool empty() const;\n    Iterator begin() const;\n    Iterator end() const;\n    void insertFront(const E& e);\n    void insertBack(const E& e);\n    void insert(const Iterator& p, const E& e);\n    void eraseFront();\n    void eraseBack();\n    void erase(const Iterator& p);\n    void printList(); \n\nprivate:\n    int n;\n    Node* header;\n    Node* trailer;\n};\n```\n\n\nNext, I made a derived class of DList named \"NodeSequence\", which is defined as the following\n\n```\n#include \"DList.h\"\nclass NodeSequence : public DList{ //NodeSequence class inherits DList class\npublic:\n    Iterator atIndex(int i) const ; //get position from index \n    int indexOf(const Iterator& p) const; //get index from position\n};\n```\n\n\nFinally, I wanted to test my code, so I demonstrated as the following.\n\n```\nint main() {\n    NodeSequence test;\n    test.insertBack(5);\n    test.insertBack(4);\n    test.insertBack(3);\n    test.insertBack(2);\n    test.insertBack(1);\n\nNodeSequence::Iterator p= test.atIndex(1);\ncout << (p.v)->element() << endl; \n// I expected 4, but it gives compile error, it says I can't access to p.v because it is a private member\n```\n\n\n}\n\nIs there any way I can get an access to the private element (which is a pointer) of the iterator?

So it this statement correct ? Moreover it says that the time complexity to insert an element in an arraylist at the end is O(1) if array is not full and O(n) if the array is full. Why O(n) if the array is full ? \n\nThanks for answering the 1st part . Can anyone please also explain the 2nd part. Thanks :)\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nIt depends on what methods you're calling.\n\nA glance at the implementation shows that if you're calling ```\nLinkedList.removeLast()```\n, that's O(1). The LinkedList maintains pointers both to the first and last node in the list. So it doesn't have to traverse the list to get to the last node.\n\nCalling ```\nLinkedList.remove(index)```\n with the index of the last element is also O(1), because it traverses the list from the closest end.

But, you are doing the other way round. So, your program crashes when it tries to access ```\narr[left]```\n or ```\narr[right]```\n when try are out-of-bound. This can be fixed by changing the order of conditions in your ```\nif```\n statement as seen below.\n\n```\nvoid max_heapify(heap h, int i) {\n    int *arr = h.arr;\n    int left = LEFT(i);\n    int right = RIGHT(i);\n    int largest = i;\n\n    /* ISSUE: You are evaluating first, checking bounds second */   \n    /* if (arr[left] > arr[i] && left <= h.heap_size) */ \n\n    /* Right way: Check bounds first, evaluate second */\n    if (left <= h.heap_size && arr[left] > arr[i]) /* Right */\n        largest = left;\n\n    /* ISSUE: You are evaluating first, checking bounds second */ \n    /* if (arr[right] > arr[largest] && right <= h.heap_size) */\n\n    /* Right way: Check bounds first, evaluate second */\n    if (right <= h.heap_size && arr[right] > arr[largest])\n        largest = right;\n\n    if (largest != i) {\n        exchange(h.arr + i, h.arr + largest);\n        max_heapify(h, largest);\n    }\n\n    return;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\nAbove change should resolve your program crash.\n\nBut there is one more issue in your code - not related to your program crash, but gives you wrong result.

{"Question": "Java - Why is this implementation of a binary heap faster than the other?\r\n                \r\nAfter reading a bit about heaps/priority queues, I recently made my own implementation of one. Afterwards I decided to compare the performance of my implementation to that of one which I found in a book, and the results are a bit confusing to me. It appears that there is a vast performance difference between the insert methods of the two implementations.\n\nI used this code to test both heaps:\n\n```\nRandom rnd = new Random();\nlong startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\nfor(int i = 0; i < 1_000_000_0; i++) heap.insert(rnd.nextInt(1000));\nSystem.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime);\n```\n\n\nWhen I run this with my heap implementation, I get a result of around 600ms.

{"Question": "How do leader selection algorithms work in distributed systems?\r\n                \r\nfor the sake of interest I decided to study the topic of distributed, high-loaded systems, read a couple of books, which wrote about replication and algorithms for selecting a new leader (Leader Election) in case of failure of the current one.  In particular I learned about Bully algorithm, Modified Bully and Ring algorithms.\nA couple of questions came up right away:\n\nAbsolutely all of these algorithms mention such a concept as priority.  The node with the higher priority is assigned as the new leader. Is the priority a random number?  Or does it usually depend on some node parameters, such as the amount of available memory, disk utilization, etc.\nIf the priority is a random number, then why do you need to poll each node and create such a long chain of requests?  It's easy to do, when a node notices that the current leader has fallen off, it immediately sends a request to all other nodes either directly or to some bus, that it is now the leader.  This will in fact be exactly the same random node, as in the case of priorities, only without a huge chain of requests.\n\n    ", "Answer": "", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "what does worst case big omega(n) means?\r\n                \r\nIf Big-Omega is the lower bound then what does it mean to have a worst case time complexity of Big-Omega(n).\nFrom the book \"data structures and algorithms with python\" by Michael T. Goodrich:\nconsider a dynamic array that doubles it size when the element reaches its capacity.\nthis is from the book:\n\n\"we fully explored the append method. In the worst case, it requires\nΩ(n) time because the underlying array is resized, but it uses O(1)time in the amortized sense\"\n\n\nThe parameterized version, pop(k), removes the element that is at index k < n\nof a list, shifting all subsequent elements leftward to fill the gap that results from\nthe removal. The efficiency of this operation is O(n−k), as the amount of shifting\ndepends upon the choice of index k. Note well that this\nimplies that pop(0) is the most expensive call, using Ω(n) time.\n\nhow is \"Ω(n)\" describes the most expensive time?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe number inside the parenthesis is the number of operations you must do to actually carry out the operation, always expressed as a function of the number of items you are dealing with.  You never worry about just how hard those operations are, only the total number of them.\nIf the array is full and has to be resized you need to copy all the elements into the new array.  One operation per item in the array, thus an O(n) runtime.  However, most of the time you just do one operation for an O(1) runtime.\nCommon values are:\nO(1):  One operation only, such as adding it to the list when the list isn't full.\nO(log n):  This typically occurs when you have a binary search or the like to find your target.  Note that the base of the log isn't specified as the difference is just a constant and you always ignore constants.\nO(n):  One operation per item in your dataset.  For example, unsorted search.\nO(n log n):  Commonly seen in good sort routines where you have to process every item but can divide and conquer as you go.\nO(n^2):  Usually encountered when you must consider every interaction of two items in your dataset and have no way to organize it.  For example a routine I wrote long ago to find near-duplicate pictures.  (Exact duplicates would be handled by making a dictionary of hashes and testing whether the hash existed and thus be O(n)--the two passes is a constant and discarded, you wouldn't say O(2n).)\nO(n^3):  By the time you're getting this high you consider it very carefully.  Now you're looking at three-way interactions of items in your dataset.\nHigher orders can exist but you need to consider carefully what's it's going to do.  I have shipped production code that was O(n^8) but with very heavy pruning of paths and even then it took 12 hours to run.  Had the nature of the data not been conductive to such pruning I wouldn't have written it at all--the code would still be running.\nYou will occasionally encounter even nastier stuff which needs careful consideration of whether it's going to be tolerable or not.  For large datasets they're impossible:\nO(2^n):  Real world example:  Attempting to prune paths so as to retain a minimum spanning tree--I computed all possible trees and kept the cheapest.  Several experiments showed n never going above 10, I thought I was ok--until a different seed produced n = 22.  I rewrote the routine for not-always-perfect answer that was O(n^2) instead.\nO(n!):  I don't know any examples.  It blows up horribly fast.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Explaining Python Example Code for Backtracking Algorithm\r\n                \r\nFrom the PacktPub's book \"Python Data Structures and Algorithms\" (authored by Benjamin Baka) section on Backtracking from chapter 3, they have this function (page 81):\n\n```\ndef bitStr(n, s):\n    if n == 1: return s\n     return [digit + bits for digit in bitStr(1, s) \n             for bits in bitStr(n - 1, s)]\n\n print(bitStr(3,'abc'))\n```\n\n\nReturns:\n\n```\n['aaa', 'aab', 'aac', 'aba', 'abb', 'abc', 'aca', 'acb', 'acc', 'baa', 'bab', 'bac', 'bba', 'bbb', 'bbc', 'bca', 'bcb', 'bcc', 'caa', 'cab', 'cac', 'cba', 'cbb', 'cbc', 'cca', 'ccb', 'ccc']\n```\n\n\nThe book's explanation:\n\n\n  Notice the double list compression and the two recursive calls within\n  this comprehension. This recursively concatenates each element of the\n  initial sequence, returned when ```\nn = 1```\n, with each element of the string\n  generated in the previous recursive call. In this sense it is\n  backtracking to uncover previously ingenerated combinations. The final\n  string that is returned is all n letter combinations of the initial\n  string.\n\n\nWell, besides how unpythonic it feels by them using a list comprehension for something like this (or maybe it's just me), I simply can't understand it.\n\nI rewrote the whole thing and added my comments to the code with what I understood so far and where I'm stuck.\n\n```\ndef test(n, s):\n     # this one's obvious\n     if n == 1: return s\n\n     result = list() # so's this\n\n     \"\"\"\n     From what I can tell, the first recursive call in the outer\n     loop forces the function's conditional statement to \n     activate. So, with the example of `abc` as the second\n     input to the function, the outer for loop just loops\n     over that string, `abc` in this case.\n     \"\"\"\n     for digit in test(1, s):\n         \"\"\"\n         This is where I start to lose my grip on what's happening.\n         So, going to the above returned list as given by the book,\n         I can see where the first item, i.e `aaa`, in the list\n         comes from.\n\n         So, here's what I see when it comes to that first item. \n         `digit` now storing the first 'a' that later get's added,\n         the second recursive call in this second loop (if w-\n         e're going with the original example call from the \n         book: `test(3, 'abc')`) sets the first input to 2 on\n         the first iteration.\n\n         I'm guessing this makes it so it avoids the conditional \n         statement. With that avoided, we still have the string\n         'abc'. \n\n         The first iteration of the loop takes the first \n         letter, 'a', and adds it to `digit`. \n\n         I'm a bit confused on how then the loop goes back through \n         the function to get the third 'a' to complete the \n         final list's first item, 'aaa'.\n\n         Though, say I did understand that at the time of posting\n         this question, what I'm totally confused about it is\n         how this supposedly 'Backtracks', and gets the\n         final list's second item, 'aab', and all subsequent items.\n         \"\"\"\n         for bits in test(n-1, s):\n             result.append(digit + bits)\n\n     return result\n```\n\n\nAny help explaining this all would be appreciated. Plus, it would be great if someone can confirm correct what I \"claim\" to understand already in my code comments. \n    ", "Answer": "", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "GA written in Java\r\n                \r\nI am attempting to write a Genetic Algorithm based on techniques I had picked up from the book \"AI Techniques for Game Programmers\" that uses a binary encoding and fitness proportionate selection (also known as roulette wheel selection) on the genes of the population that are randomly generated within the program in a two-dimensional array.\n\nI recently came across a piece of pseudocode and have tried to implement it, but have come across some problems with the specifics of what I need to be doing. I've checked a number of books and some open-source code and am still struggling to progress. \nI understand that I have to get the sum of the total fitness of the population, pick a random number between the sum and zero, then if the number is greater than the parents to overwrite it, but I am struggling with the implementation of these ideas.\n\nAny help in the implementation of these ideas would be very much appreciated as my Java is rusty.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThe following is a complete outline of the GA. I made sure to be very detailed so it can be easily coded to C/Java/Python/..\n\n```\n/* 1. Init population */\nPOP_SIZE = number of individuals in the population\npop = newPop = []\nfor i=1 to POP_SIZE {\n    pop.add( getRandomIndividual() )\n}\n\n/* 2. evaluate current population */\ntotalFitness = 0\nfor i=1 to POP_SIZE {\n    fitness = pop[i].evaluate()\n    totalFitness += fitness\n}\n\nwhile not end_condition (best fitness, #iterations, no improvement...)\n{\n    // build new population\n    // optional: Elitism: copy best K from current pop to newPop\n    while newPop.size()<POP_SIZE\n    {\n        /* 3. roulette wheel selection */\n        // select 1st individual\n        rnd = getRandomDouble([0,1]) * totalFitness\n        for(idx=0; idx<POP_SIZE && rnd>0; idx++) {\n            rnd -= pop[idx].fitness\n        }\n        indiv1 = pop[idx-1]\n        // select 2nd individual\n        rnd = getRandomDouble([0,1]) * totalFitness\n        for(idx=0; idx<POP_SIZE && rnd>0; idx++) {\n            rnd -= pop[idx].fitness\n        }\n        indiv2 = pop[idx-1]\n\n        /* 4. crossover */\n        indiv1, indiv2 = crossover(indiv1, indiv2)\n\n        /* 5. mutation */\n        indiv1.mutate()\n        indiv2.mutate()\n\n        // add to new population\n        newPop.add(indiv1)\n        newPop.add(indiv2)\n    }\n    pop = newPop\n    newPop = []\n\n    /* re-evaluate current population */\n    totalFitness = 0\n    for i=1 to POP_SIZE {\n        fitness = pop[i].evaluate()\n        totalFitness += fitness\n    }\n}\n\n// return best genome\nbestIndividual = pop.bestIndiv()     // max/min fitness indiv\n```\n\n\nNote that currently you're missing a fitness function (depends on the domain).

Could someone please help me explain why is that? \n    ", "Answer": "\r\nIf you only have two data streams then you really don't need a heap as the following algorithm will do:\n\n```\nLet s1 ans s2 be the two streams\n\nwhile s1.hasData() and s2.hasData()\n    if s1.peek() < s2.peek(): datum = s1.pop()\n    else: datum = s2.pop()\n    s.push(datum)\nif either is non-empty (only one is), add the rest of its content to s\n```\n\n\nAs pointed out by Henk Holterman, if you have ```\nk>2```\n streams, then you achieve the merging via heap (essentially the heap does the now-complicated decision of which stream to use in the current step):\n\n```\nlet H be a (min  or max, depending on your needs) heap\nlet s1, s2, ..., sk be sorted streams\n\n// fill the heap with the first elements from the streams (e.g. min/max elements from each stream, depending on how they're sorted)\nfor i=1 to k:\n    H.add((i, si.pop())) // we need to know which stream the element came from\n\nlet s be the initially-empty data stream which will contain the merged content in sorted order\n// H.empty() will indicate that all streams are empty\nwhile not H.empty():\n    // take the min/max element of the min/max elements of each stream (*the* min/max element)\n    (i, datum) = H.extract()\n    // add it to s\n    s.push(datum)\n    // we know the datum came from s[i]; thus we need to push the next element from the i-th stream into heap as it may contain the next min/max element (that is, if s[i] isn't empty)\n    if not s[i].empty():\n        // we'll assume the heap sorts based on the second component of the pair\n        H.add((i, s[i].pop())\n// s is the sorted stream containing elements from s1,s2,...,sk\n```\n\n\nThis running time of this is ```\nO((|s1|+...+|sk|) * log k)```\n, where ```\n|si|```\n denotes the number of elements in the stream ```\nsi```\n.\n\nThe key idea is that in each iteration of the ```\nwhile```\n-loop you add the smallest/largest of ```\ns[1].peek()```\n, ```\ns[2].peek()```\n, ..., ```\ns[k].peek()```\n to ```\ns```\n.

But imagine multiplies are a lot more expensive than additions, so we want to reduce the number of multiplications if at all possible.  Strassen uses a trick to compute the right hand side with one less multiply and a lot more additions (and some subtractions).\n\nHere are the 7 multiplies:\n\n```\nM1 = (A + D) * (E + H) = AE + AH + DE + DH\nM2 = (A + B) * H = AH + BH\nM3 = (C + D) * E = CE + DE\nM4 = A * (F - H) = AF - AH\nM5 = D * (G - E) = DG - DE\nM6 = (C - A) * (E + F) = CE + CF - AE - AF\nM7 = (B - D) * (G + H) = BG + BH - DG - DH\n```\n\n\nSo to compute AE+BG, start with M1+M7 (which gets us the AE and BG terms), then add/subtract some of the other Ms until AE+BG is all we are left with.  Miraculously, the M's are chosen so that M1+M7-M2+M5 works.

Tail recursion is always equivalent to a loop and writing the loop explicitly can be more efficient, depending on the compiler.(*) Modern compilers such as GCC can optimize tail recursion away, but they don't always recognize it. When they don't see it, the recursion will consume stack space.\n\nThat said, an algorithm such as quicksort is naturally expressed recursively and one of its two recursions is a tail recursion. I'd write it recursively on a first pass and then rewrite it as a loop if I found that it was too slow.\n\nWhen an algorithm has only a single recursion that is a tail recursion, it might still be a good idea to write it as a loop right away, because recursive functions can be harder to debug than loops.\n\n(*) I'm assuming we're talking about C only.

I compiled this using optimization level -O3 and the assembly is shown here:\n\n```\n find:\n.LFB23:\n    .cfi_startproc\n    pushq   %r14\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16\n    .cfi_offset 14, -16\n    pushq   %r13\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 24\n    .cfi_offset 13, -24\n    pushq   %r12\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 32\n    .cfi_offset 12, -32\n    pushq   %rbp\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 40\n    .cfi_offset 6, -40\n    pushq   %rbx\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 48\n    .cfi_offset 3, -48\n    leaq    (%rdi,%rsi,8), %rbx\n    movq    (%rbx), %rax\n    cmpq    %rsi, %rax\n    je  .L2\n    leaq    (%rdi,%rax,8), %rbp\n    movq    0(%rbp), %rdx\n    cmpq    %rdx, %rax\n    je  .L3\n    leaq    (%rdi,%rdx,8), %r12\n    movq    %rdx, %rax\n    movq    (%r12), %rcx\n    cmpq    %rcx, %rdx\n    je  .L4\n    leaq    (%rdi,%rcx,8), %r13\n    movq    %rcx, %rax\n    movq    0(%r13), %rdx\n    cmpq    %rdx, %rcx\n    je  .L5\n    leaq    (%rdi,%rdx,8), %r14\n    movq    %rdx, %rax\n    movq    (%r14), %rsi\n    cmpq    %rsi, %rdx\n    je  .L6\n    call    find           // <--- Recursion!\n    movq    %rax, (%r14)\n.L6:\n    movq    %rax, 0(%r13)\n.L5:\n    movq    %rax, (%r12)\n.L4:\n    movq    %rax, 0(%rbp)\n.L3:\n    movq    %rax, (%rbx)\n.L2:\n    popq    %rbx\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 40\n    popq    %rbp\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 32\n    popq    %r12\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 24\n    popq    %r13\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16\n    popq    %r14\n    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 8\n    ret\n    .cfi_endproc\n```\n\n\nGiven the existence of the recursive call in the middle, it doesn't look like this tail call was eliminated. In fairness, that's because the transformation you're describing is pretty nontrivial, so I'm not surprised it didn't find it. This doesn't mean that no optimizing compiler can find it, but that one major one won't.\n\nYour second question is why we present the algorithm this way. As someone who teaches both algorithms and programming, I think it's extremely valuable to discuss algorithms using a presentation that's as simple as possible, even if it means abstracting away some particular implementation details. Here, the key idea behind the algorithm is to update the parent pointers of all the nodes encountered up on the way to the representative. Recursion happens to be a pretty clean way of describing that idea, even though when implemented naively it risks a stack overflow. However, by expressing the pseudocode in that particular way, it's easier to describe and discuss it and to prove that it will work as advertised. We could describe it the other way to avoid a stack overflow, but in Theoryland we usually don't worry about details like that and the updated presentation, while more directly translatable into practice, would make it harder to see the key ideas.\n\nWhen looking at pseudocode for more advanced algorithms and data structures, it's common to omit critically important implementation details and to handwave that certain tasks are possible to do in certain time bounds. When discussing algorithms or data structures that build on top of even more complex algorithms and data structures, it often becomes impossible to write out pseudocode for everything because you have layers on top of layers on top of layers of glossed-over details. From a theoretical perspective, this is fine - if the reader does want to implement it, they can fill in the blanks. On the other hand, if the reader is more interested in the key techniques from the paper and the theory (which in academic settings is common), they won't get bogged down in implementation details.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Difference between Running time and Execution time in algorithm?\r\n                \r\nI'm currently reading this book called CLRS 2.2 page 25. In which the author describes the Running time of an algorithm as\n\nThe running time of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of primitive\noperations or “steps” executed.\n\nAlso the author uses the running time to analyze algorithms. Then I referred a book called Data Structures and Algorithms made easy by Narasimha Karumanchi.\nIn which he describes the following.\n\n1.7 Goal of the Analysis of Algorithms\nThe goal of the analysis of algorithms is to compare algorithms (or solutions) mainly in terms of\nrunning time but also in terms of other factors (e.g., memory, developer effort, etc.)\n1.9 How to Compare Algorithms:\nTo compare algorithms, let us define a few objective measures:\nExecution times? Not a good measure as execution times are specific to a particular computer.\nNumber of statements executed? Not a good measure, since the number of statements varies\nwith the programming language as well as the style of the individual programmer.\nIdeal solution? Let us assume that we express the running time of a given algorithm as a function\nof the input size n (i.e., f(n)) and compare these different functions corresponding to running\ntimes. This kind of comparison is independent of machine time, programming style, etc.\n\nAs you can see from CLRS the author describes the running time as the number of steps executed whereas in the second book the author says its not a good measure to use Number of step executed to analyze the algorithms. Also the running time depends on the computer (my assumption) but the author from the second book says that we cannot consider the Execution time to analyze algorithms as it totally depends on the computer.\nI thought the execution time and the running time are same!\nSo,\n\nWhat is the real meaning or definition of running time and execution time? Are they the same of different?\nDoes running time describe the number of steps executed or not?\nDoes running time depend on the computer or not?\n\nthanks in advance.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\n\nWhat is the real meaning or definition of running time and execution time? Are they the same of different?\n\nThe definition of \"running time\" in 'Introduction to Algorithms' by C,L,R,S [CLRS] is actually not a time, but a number of steps. This is not what you would intuitively use as a definition. Most would agree that \"runnning\" and \"executing\" are the same concept, and that \"time\" is expressed in a unit of time (like milliseconds). So while we would normally consider these two terms to have the same meaning, in CLRS they have deviated from that, and gave a different meaning to \"running time\".\n\nDoes running time describe the number of steps executed or not?\n\nIt does mean that in CLRS. But the definition that CLRS uses for \"running time\" is particular, and not the same as you might encounter in other resources.\nCLRS assumes here that a primitive operation (i.e. a step) takes O(1) time.\nThis is typically true for CPU instructions, which take up to a fixed maximum number of cycles (where each cycle represents a unit of time), but it may not be true in higher level languages. For instance, some languages have a ```\nsort```\n instruction. Counting that as a single \"step\" would give useless results in an analysis.\nBreaking down an algorithm into its O(1) steps does help to analyse the complexity of an algorithm. Counting the steps for different inputs may only give a hint about the complexity though. Ultimately, the complexity of an algorithm requires a (mathematical) proof, based on the loops and the known complexity of the steps used in an algorithm.\n\nDoes running time depend on the computer or not?\n\nCertainly the execution time may differ. This is one of the reasons we want to by a new computer once in a while.\nThe number of steps may depend on the computer. If both support the same programming language, and you count steps in that language, then: yes. But if you would do the counting more thoroughly and would count the CPU instructions that are actually ran by the compiled program, then it might be different. For instance, a C compiler on one computer may generate different machine code than a different C compiler on another computer, and so the number of CPU instructions may be less on the one than the other, even though they result from the same C program code.\nPractically however, this counting at CPU instruction level is not relevant for determining the complexity of an algorithm. We generally know the time complexity of each instruction in the higher level language, and that is what counts for determining the overall complexity of an algorithm.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Since we've shown that ```\n(+)```\n holds for on set of constants ```\n(c,n0```\n), we can show that it holds for an infinite amount of different such choices of constants (e.g., it naturally holds for ```\nc=10```\n and ```\nn0=20```\n, ..., and so on).\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "Linked list vs. dynamic array for implementing a stack\r\n                \r\nI've started reviewing data structures and algorithms before my final year of school starts to make sure I'm on top of everything.  One review problem said \"Implement a stack using a linked list or dynamic array and explain why you made the best choice\".\n\nTo me, it seemed more intuitive to use a list with a tail pointer to implement a stack since it may need to be resized often.  It seems like for a large amount of data, a list is the better choice since a dynamic array re-size is an expensive operation.  Additionally, with a list, you don't need to allocate any more space than you actually need so it's more space efficient.\n\nHowever, a dynamic array would definitely allow for adding data far quicker (except when it needs to be resized).  However, I'm not sure if using an array is overall quicker, or only if it doesn't need to be resized.\n\nThe book's solution said \"for storing very large objects, a list is a better implementation\" but I don't understand why.\n\nWhich way is best?  What factors should be used to determine which implementation is \"best\"?  Also, is any of my logic here off?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThere are many tradeoffs involved here and I don't think that there's a \"correct\" answer to this question.\n\nIf you implement the stack using a linked list with a tail pointer, then the worst-case runtime to push, pop, or peek is O(1).  However, each element will have some extra overhead associated with it (namely, the pointer) that means that there is always O(n) overhead for the structure.  Additionally, depending on the speed of your memory allocator, the cost of allocating new nodes for the stack might be noticeable.  Also, if you were to continuously pop off all the elements from the stack, you might have a performance hit from poor locality, since there is no guarantee that the linked list cells will be stored contiguously in memory.\n\nIf you implement the stack with a dynamic array, then the amortized runtime to push or pop is O(1) and the worst-case cost of a peek is O(1).  This means that if you care about the cost of any single operation in the stack, this may not be the best approach.  That said, allocations are infrequent, so the total cost of adding or removing n elements is likely to be faster than the corresponding cost in the linked-list based approach.  Additionally, the memory overhead of this approach is usually better than the memory overhead of the linked list.  If your dynamic array just stores pointers to the elements, then the memory overhead in the worst-case occurs when half the elements are filled in, in which case there are n extra pointers (the same as in the case when you were using the linked list), and in the best case when the dynamic array is full there are no empty cells and the extra overhead is O(1).  If, on the other hand, your dynamic array directly contains the elements, the memory overhead can be worse in the worst-case.  Finally, because the elements are stored contiguously, there is better locality if you want to continuously push or pop elements from the stack, since all the elements are right next to each other in memory.\n\nIn short:\n\n\nThe linked-list approach has worst-case O(1) guarantees on each operation; the dynamic array has amortized O(1) guarantees.\nThe locality of the linked list is not as good as the locality of the dynamic array.\nThe total overhead of the dynamic array is likely to be smaller than the total overhead of the linked list, assuming both store pointers to their elements.\nThe total overhead of the dynamic array is likely to be greater than that of the linked list if the elements are stored directly.\n\n\nNeither of these structures is clearly \"better\" than the other.  It really depends on your use case.  The best way to figure out which is faster would be to time both and see which performs better.\n\nHope this helps!\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}
{"Question": "How to implement circular linked list in java?\r\n                \r\nI read a book about \"Data structures and algorithms\" in which there is assignment which asks me to implement a circular linked list.

Generally hashes take values and multiply it by a prime number (makes it more likely to generate unique hashes) So you could do something like:\n\n```\nint hash=7;\nfor (int i=0; i < strlen; i++) {\n    hash = hash*31+charAt(i);\n}\n```\n\n\nIf a word is already present,increment the corresponding count. Maintain a min heap of size 10.When a word is scanned,find its frequency.If it is greater than the minimum in the heap,delete the minimum & insert &update the heap.\nAt the last,we are left with the 10 most frequent words in the heap.\nWhats the problem?\nThis approach works only when all the words can be accommodated in the memory at the same time.\n\nAnother approach is to use the external sorting as size of book is much as compared to the physical memory. After sorting, a linear search could do our job. But, what about the access time from the disk? Seek time & latency time can increment the access time.\nSo, this approach is also not efficient. \n\nI can think of yet another approach: DISTRIBUTED HASHING (will work only when we have n machines). Distribute hashing among n machines. We may perform different strategies, say we have 26 machines, then we may hash all the words staring with alphabet 'a'('A') in machine 1,words starting with 'b'('B') and so on.

For example, (book, bouk) and (book,bo0k). I am looking for an algorithm that can gives different scores for these two examples. I am thinking about using fastText or BPE, however they use cosine distance. \n\nIs there any algorithm that can solve this?\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nThat is a very interesting question - probably with many possible answers. You could possibly add in bigram (n-gram) analysis to rank how likely the letters would be related to each other in typical words.\n\nPresuming your system doesn't \"know\" the target word, but someone types \"bouk\". Then it analyses all the bigrams:\n\nbo, ou, uk\n\nor trigrams\n\nbou, ouk\n\nI would guess here that \"bo\", \"ou\", \"bou\" would score well as they are common, but \"uk\" and \"ouk\" would be not likely in English. So this could simply have a 3/5 score, but actually each trigram would have its own frequency score (probability), so the overall number for the proposed word could be quite refined.\n\nThen comparing that to \"bo0k\" you'd look at all bigrams:\n\nbo, o0, 0k\n\nor trigrams\n\nbo0, o0k\n\nNow you can see that only \"bo\" would score well here. All the others would not be found in a common n-gram corpus. So this word would score much lower than \"bouk\" for likelihood, e.g. 1/5 compared to the 3/5 for \"bouk\".\n\nThere would be roughly three parts to the solution:\n\nYou would need a corpus of established n-gram frequencies for the language. For example this random blog I found discusses that:  https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2014/09/26/bigrams.html\n\nThen you would need to process (tokenise and scan) your input words into n-grams and then look up their frequencies in the corpus. You could use something like SK Learn, \n\nThen you can sum the parts in whatever way you like to establish the overall score for the word. \n\nNote you may find most tokenisers and n-gram processing for natural language centres around word relations not letters within words. It's easy to get lost on that, as often the fact a library is focused on word-grams is not explicitly mentioned because it's the most common. I've noticed that before, but n-grams are used in all sorts of other data sets too (timeseries, music, any sequence really) This question does discuss how you can convert SK Learn's vectoriser to do letter-grams, but I've not tried this myself: N-grams for letter in sklearn\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "What do the constant factors in a time complexity equation represent?\r\n                \r\nall.\nI'm taking a Coursera course on data structures and algorithms to prep myself for my upcoming semester which has a data structures and algorithms course. In my study I'm currently on the topic of algorithm analysis. This lead to me going down a rabbit hole and reading other resources. In one of those resources they have a time complexity equation for Insertion-Sort:\n\nMy question is what exactly do the constant factors in the equation (C_1, C_2, C_3, etc.) represent? My understanding is they represent the run time to execute a specific line (so C_2 represents the time it takes to execute key = A[j]. This is based on the understanding that the equation represents time complexity, and time complexity is a measurement of the change in runtime as input size changes (Figure 2 and Figure 3 below):\n\n\nOf course, you can see in the same sentence the authors of Introduction to Algorithms say C_i is a measurement of steps. Then in the book A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition the author says this:\n\nIf you take away just one thing from this book, let it be this: when we measure\nhow “fast” an operation takes, we do not refer to how fast the operation takes\nin terms of pure time, but instead in how many steps it takes.\nWe’ve actually seen this earlier in the context of printing the even numbers\nfrom 2 to 100. The second version of that function was faster because it took\nhalf as many steps as the first version did.\n\n\nWhy do we measure code’s speed in terms of steps?\nWe do this because we can never say definitively that any operation takes,\nsay, five seconds. While a piece of code may take five seconds on a particular\ncomputer, that same piece of code may take longer on an older piece of\nhardware. For that matter, that same code might run much faster on the\nsupercomputers of tomorrow. Measuring the speed of an operation in terms\nof time is undependable, since the time will always change depending on the\nhardware it is run on.\n\n\nHowever, we can measure the speed of an operation in terms of how many\ncomputational steps it takes. If Operation A takes 5 steps, and Operation B\ntakes 500 steps, we can assume that Operation A will always be faster than\nOperation B on all pieces of hardware. Measuring the number of steps is,\ntherefore, the key to analyzing the speed of an operation.\n\n\nMeasuring the speed of an operation is also known as measuring its time\ncomplexity. Throughout this book, I’ll use the terms speed, time complexity,\nefficiency, performance, and runtime interchangeably. They all refer to the\nnumber of steps a given operation takes.\n\nThe Wikipedia page for Time Complexity says:\n\nIn computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform.\n\nSo there seems to be a dual definition and understanding of time complexity and what the equation represents. I see that intrinsically, the more steps an algorithm takes the longer it's going to take. I also understand that it's usually very difficult or impossible to measure the exact running time of an algorithm and therefor may be efficacious to count the number of steps an algorithm takes.\nThat said, I'm having a difficult time fulling making this connection between the two, and ultimately what those constant factors in the equation represent. If they do represent running time, why are they then counted as just a constant and seem to be counted as 1 (1 for each time the line is executed)?\nHoping someone out there can help me understand what the equation represents, the connection between runtime and steps, etc.\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this and for your help.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nI think the constants represent the steps that must be taken to execute each line.

{"Question": "Knowing what the contents of variables are going to be, how do I determine what to place inside the <> to eliminate \"raw type\" warnings?\r\n                \r\nI’m working on a program that utilizes evolutionary algorithms.  This program was written prior to the introduction of Java generics.  One of the many tasks I’ve been given is to remove the “raw type” warnings this legacy code is producing.\n\nI’ve looked at several Java reference books and read all the answers to questions concerning the removal of these type warnings and haven’t found what I’m looking for.  I can’t simply add the ? wildcard to the variable declarations to remove the warnings unless that is the only valid solution.\n\nHere is an example snippet of code that is issuing warnings.  Knowing what the contents of the three variables that are issuing the “raw type” warnings are going to be, how do I determine what to place inside the <> to eliminate the warnings?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n```\n/**\n * Uses the information from the configuration file to instantiate\n * the right classes for the environment, statistics, algorithm slots\n */\n\nprivate void reificate() {\ntry{\nRaw type warning --> Class c =  null;\nRaw type warning --> Class params1 [] =  new Class[1];\nRaw type warning --> java.lang.reflect.Constructor  cons =  null;\n                     Object [] params2 =  new Object[1];\n\n// Instantiating a configuration object\n\nc           =  Class.forName(cfgSB.toString());\nparams1[0]  =  Class.forName(\"java.lang.String\");\ncons        =  c.getConstructor(params1);\nparams2[0]  =  new String(cfgFileName);\ncfg  =  cons.newInstance(params2);\n\n(The following code will require additional Class type variables to be declared, but if I can \nlearn how to eliminate the warnings above, I’ll know how to declare the new variables properly.)\n\n// Instantiating an environment\n\nc           =  Class.forName(envSB.toString());\nparams1[0]  =  Class.forName(\"jade.core.Config\");\ncons        =  c.getConstructors()[0];\nparams2[0]  =  cfg;\nenv  =  cons.newInstance(params2);\n\n// Instantiating an Algo object to run\n\nc           =  Class.forName(algSB.toString());\ncons        =  c.getConstructors()[0];\nparams2[0]  =  cfg;\nalg  =  (jade.core.EvolAlgo)cons.newInstance(params2);\n\n// Creating statistics object and attaching it to cfg\n\n// This has to be done last since statistics constructor is\n// going to refer to the population of Algo via  a local attribute C\n\nc           =  Class.forName(staSB.toString());\ncons        =  c.getConstructors()[0];\nparams2[0]  =  cfg;\nsta  =  (jade.stats.Statistics)cons.newInstance(params2);\n// ********************* end of snippet **************************//\n```\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\n```\nClass.forName()```\n returns ```\nClass<?>```\n, see documentation.\n\nIt can't return a ```\nClass<String>```\n even when you specify ```\njava.lang.String```\n since there is no mapping between the string name and the actual class at compile time.\n\nThe same applies to constructors, parameters, .. You can only specify a concrete class type if you have a real runtime type (obtainable via ```\nString.class```\n for example). \n\nI'd do it roughly like:\n\n```\njade.core.Config cfg = (jade.core.Config) Class.forName(cfgSB.toString())\n        .getConstructor(String.class)\n        .newInstance(cfgFileName);\n\n// not sure what type that is..\nObject env = Class.forName(envSB.toString())\n        .getConstructor(jade.core.Config.class)\n        .newInstance(cfg);\n\njade.core.EvolAlgo alg = (jade.core.EvolAlgo) Class.forName(algSB.toString)\n        .getConstructor(jade.core.Config.class)\n        .newInstance(cfg);\n\njade.stats.Statistics sta = (jade.stats.Statistics) Class.forName(staSB.toString())\n        .getConstructor(jade.core.Config.class)\n        .newInstance(cfg);\n```\n\n\nThere is no need to create extra arrays, the methods take a comma separated list of things (varargs). You also don't need to specify ```\nforName(\"java.lang.String\")```\n since you can use the actual type here. And since you seem to know the type, you can use the ```\ngetConstructor```\n method instead of hoping that the first constructor is the correct one.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Having trouble understanding how many arrays are actually created in the merge sort algorithm\r\n                \r\nI've been studying about the merge sort algorithm and I can't conclude how many arrays are actually created as part of the algorithm. Certain literature says that the entire original array is copied into a new array that's sorted. But that means only 2 arrays were created. \n\nAs far as I understand, the merge sort algorithm has 2 major steps. Splitting and Merging. I thought if you give merge sort an array of 100 slots, it actually creates new arrays as it splits down the middle from 100 > 50/50 > 25/25 > 12/13 > 6/5 > 3/3 > 1/1. After all those splits at this point it has 12 or 13 arrays in memory. And then when finally it copies all these into new arrays from 1 > 2 > 3 or 4 > 6 > 12 > 25 > 50 > 100. \n\nThat's another 8 arrays (roughly speaking). \n\nBut in text books I read things like this: \n\n\n  You may wonder where all these subarrays are located in memory. In the\n  algorithm, a workspace array of the same size as the original array is\n  created. The subarrays are stored in sections of the workspace array.\n  This means that subarrays in the original array are copied to\n  appropriate places in the workspace array. After each merge, the\n  workspace array is copied back into the original array.\n\n\n-- Data Structures and Algorithms in Java By Robert Lafore\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nConsider a pair of final stages of the typical merge sort implementation.

{"Question": "Linked List - remove duplicates algorithm in C#/Java\r\n                \r\nI am studying Data Structures and Algorithms in C#/Java. After encountering a solution to the problem of Linked List duplicate removal, I have been struggling to understand it.\nThe solution is the one proposed by the renowned book Cracking the coding Interview (5th edition, page 208).\n```\nvoid RemoveDuplicates_HashSet(Node n)\n{\n    HashSet<object> set = new HashSet<object>();\n\n    Node previous = null;\n    while (n != null)\n    {\n        if (set.Contains(n.Data))       // Condition 1\n            previous.Next = n.Next;\n        else                            // Condition 2\n        {\n            set.Add(n.Data);\n            previous = n;\n        }\n            \n        n = n.Next;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRunning the code with the following linked list ```\nA->B->A->B```\n:\n```\n// Creating test Singly LinkedList\nNode n = new Node(\"A\");\nn.Next = new Node(\"B\");\nn.Next.Next = new Node(\"A\");\nn.Next.Next.Next = new Node(\"B\");\n\nRemoveDuplicates_HashSet(n);\n```\n\nWorks perfectly fine: the value of ```\nn```\n after the method is ```\nA->B```\n.\nBy following the code with a debugger, I can see that what happens in the method loop is the following:\n```\n| Pass | HashSet | n          | previous   | Comment                  |\n| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |\n| –    | –       | A->B->A->B | null       |                          |\n| 1    | A       | B->A->B    | A->B->A->B | Condition 2 is triggered |\n| 2    | A,B     | A->B       | B->A->B    | Condition 2 is triggered |\n| 3    | A,B     | B          | B->B       | Condition 1 is triggered |\n| 4    | A,B     | null       | B          | Condition 1 is triggered |\n```\n\nI fail to understand how this actually results in several ways:\n\nWhere/how exactly are duplicates dropped from ```\nn```\n? I understand that HashSet contains only unique elements, and it will therefore detect if an element was encountered already, however I still cannot see how the algorithm works in its entirety.\n\nHow is it that the values pointed to by ```\nn```\n are updated to be ```\nA->B```\n? Where is it that, given that essentially the loop is simply iterating over the Linked List doing ```\nn = n.Next```\n, ```\nn```\n is actually updated with the final value ```\nA->B```\n? I understand that the list is passed by reference, but I cannot see how it is actually modified.\n\n\n    ", "Answer": "\r\n\nWhere/how exactly are duplicates dropped from n?\n\nA property of a Set if, that it may not contain duplicate elements.\n```\nif (set.Contains(n.Data))\n            previous.Next = n.Next;\nelse\n{\n            set.Add(n.Data);\n            previous = n;\n}\nn = n.Next;\n```\n\nHere you first check, if the data of the current node ```\nn```\n is contained in the set. If yes, the successor of the previous node is the next node of the current node ```\nn```\n.\nSo:\n```\n[previous]->[n]->[next]\n[previous]->[next]\n```\n\nOtherwise, the data is added to the set, and you proceed with the next node.\n\nHow is it that the values pointed to by n are updated to be A->B?

Do you mean \"Why is the list modified?\"\nIf yes, then because it is passed (a bit simplified ) by reference. So you just dont do a copy, like with primitve types (int,long, ...), but you modify the object itself.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

For example one of the menu options will be \"Area of Parallelogram\" when clicked the User Control will show to the right of the selection menu (within a Panel) with the input boxes for height and width, a button to calculate it and an output Textbox for the results.

Implement a queue with three stacks so that each queue operation takes a constant (worst-case) number of stack operations. Warning : high degree of difficulty.\n\n\nI know how to make a queue with 2 stacks but I can't find the solution with 3 stacks.

However, it works without lazy execution.\n\nUPDATE: Okasaki's paper is here: http://www.eecs.usma.edu/webs/people/okasaki/jfp95.ps and it seems that he actually uses only 2 stacks for the O(1) version that has lazy evaluation. The problem is that it's really based on lazy evaluation. The question is if it can be translated to a 3-stack algorithm without lazy evaluation.\n\nUPDATE: Another related algorithm is described in paper \"Stacks versus Deques\" by Holger Petersen, published in 7th Annual Conference on Computing and Combinatorics. You can find the article from Google Books. Check pages 225-226. But the algorithm is not actually real-time simulation, it's linear-time simulation of a double-ended queue on three stacks.\n\ngusbro: \"As @Leonel said some days ago, I thought it would be fair to check with Prof. Sedgewick if he knew a solution or there was some mistake. So I did write to him. I just received a response (albeit not from himself but from a colleague at Princeton) so I like to share with all of you.He basically said that he knew of no algorithms using three stacks AND the other constraints imposed (like not using lazy evaluation). He did know of an algorithm using 6 stacks as we already know looking at the answers here.

What I did is I selected the entire table like this:\n\n```\npublic function searchBooks(userInput:String)\n    {\n        var stat:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement();\n        stat.sqlConnection = _connection;\n        stat.text = \"SELECT id, title, isbn, category, authors, publisher, edition, copies, pdf, cover FROM books ORDER BY id\";\n        //stat.parameters['@search'] = \"%\" + userInput + \"%\";\n        stat.execute();\n        trace(stat.text);\n        searchedString = userInput;\n        stat.addEventListener(SQLEvent.RESULT, createSearchedContent, false, 0, true); \n    }\n\n\nprivate function createSearchedContent(e:SQLEvent):void \n    {\n        var result:SQLResult = e.target.getResult();\n        _allBooks = result;\n        trace(result.data);\n        var numResults:uint = result.data.length;\n        var currentY:Number = 0;\n        var xIterator:Number = 0;\n\n        for (var i:int = 0; i < numResults; i++)\n        {\n            var row:Object = result.data[i]; \n            var bookTitle:String = String(result.data[i].title);\n\n            if (bookTitle.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchedString.toLowerCase()) > -1)\n            {\n                var book:Book = new Book(row.title, row.isbn, row.category, row.authors, row.publisher, row.edition, row.copies, row.pdf, row.cover);\n                book.x = book.width * xIterator + 10;\n                book.y = currentY;\n                addChild(book);\n                xIterator++;\n\n                if (xIterator == 7)\n                {\n                    xIterator = 0;\n                    currentY += book.height + 10;\n                }\n\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n\nSurprisingly enough, I got the same error. I didn't get it at all. Then I put this in the above loop:\n\n```\nvar a:String = _main.search_txt.text.toLowerCase();\nvar b:String = String(row.title.toLowerCase());\n\ntrace(b.indexOf(a), a, b);\n```\n\n\nWhat I found out is that , in the trace I always get -1 for the searched term.\n\nHere is the output window:\n\n```\n-1 data dark matter and the dinosaures\n-1 data a history of religious ideas\n-1 data steve jobs\n-1 data digital logic design\n-1 data thomas calculus\n-1 data Data structures and algorithms in java\n-1 data data structures in c++\n-1 data data structures and algorithms in java\n-1 data data structures and algorithms in java\n```\n\n\nSo can any one help me out here??

{"Question": "JQuery Tablesorter - leave the first row intact\r\n                \r\nI am using the jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 plugin to create a sortable table of ... say books.\nThe very first row of the table will be a summary of all books, and I want it to always be at the top.\n\nI need to customize the behavior of the tablesorter, but I do not think I can/should do that with a custom parser. What I think I need is a custom comparator function - one that would allow me to compare any two rows myself, ideally also being able to invoke the default behavior if the condition that I am looking for has not been met.\n\nSample algorithm would be like so (hopefully I did not invert my result):\n\n```\nfunction customSort(lhs, rhs, table, column_index) {\n    if (lhs === 'magic_str') {\n        return -1; // Magic string wins\n    }\n    if (rhs === 'magic_str') {\n        return 1; // Magic string wins\n    }\n    return defaultSort(lhs, rhs, table, column_index);\n}\n```\n\n\nNow, I know some JS but not enough to pry a popular library open and rewrite parts of it, particularly as a patch that would go on top, after I load the original.

Why is the following two implementations of the PredatoryCreditCard.charge method flawed ?\n\n```\npublic boolean charge(double price) {\n    boolean isSuccess = super.charge(price);\n    if(!isSuccess)\n       charge(5); //penalty for late fee\n     return isSuccess;\n }\n```\n\n\nSecond one:\n\n```\npublic boolean charge(double price) {\n    boolean isSuccess = super.charge(price);\n    if(!isSuccess)\n       super.charge(5); //penalty for late fee\n     return isSuccess;\n }\n```\n\n\nWhat I understand is that a subclass can not directly manipulate a private field of it's super class. The field must be protected or public. This allows us to say in the subclass ```\nthis.balance += 5```\n. My understanding of the principles is not the issue, my problem is with the question i'm asked to answer. From an implementation stand point, there is no flaw that I can clearly see in the PredatoryCreditCard.charge method as in both cases of the new implementation provided by the question, we are changing the balance field of the class regardless, because of the call to super. I can't find a flaw in the new implementation unless I think there is some hole in my knowledge of inheritance.\n\nThank you in advance. \n    ", "Answer": "\r\nIn either case, you can't be charged a fee if you are close enough to the balance that the fee (of value 5) would exceed your limit.

I have been digging through quite a few data mining books and while I have found a few that spend a chapter or two on the topic of data pre-processing I am a little surprised at how most gloss over it entirely.  Thanks again.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nI have never found anything approaching a comprehensive resource on the topic of 'data pre-processing'.\n\nYour question is directed to the essential predicate step in Machine Learning of identifying each variable (variables just refer to the Fields in your SQL Tables or the columns in your data matrix) in your data as either continuous or discrete. Discrete variables are also referred to as Factors and Categorical variables. (There is a third type, time (usually a specialized data type in your language of choice) which is a genuine hybrid between the first two.)\n\nOne source i can recommend is (by no means the best or even the best i have read, rather it's just a title i can recall from memory and that describes the issue at hand reasonably well and provides some educated guidance):\n\nStatistics Nutshell by Sarah Boslaugh & Paul Andrew Watters, O'Reilly Eds. (Ch 10 Categorical Variables) \n\nDiscrete/Categorical Variables\n\nCategorical variables ('Factors' in R) are variables like Sex (values: male/female), State of Residence (e.g., Vermont, Idaho, etc.), Eye Color, and from your Question, Store Number. The Store Number might be 555, but you should probably record that as a string rather than an integer or a float (i.e., so that the algorithm treats the value 555 just as if they were \"five fifty five\". If you are doing your work on a statistics platform (e.g., SAS, SPSS, R) then the platform will provide specific guidance. In R for instance, it's common to set Store Number as a factor when you import the data. \n\nThe distinction between continuous variables and factors is absolutely essential for just about any analytical work because it determines (i) the analytical operations you can run against your data; and (ii) the type of predictive algorithm you can use.\n\nW/r/t the first item, cross-tabulation (the function xtabs in R) is a common analytical operation that you can perform only on factors. (note: it's referred to as a contingency table if instead of raw counts, percents are recorded.) Imagine that you have a data set comprised of rows from a server access log aggregated so that one row is one user in one session. Suppose that you have configured the log to record, among other things, referral URL and browser type. A cross-tab of these two variables just shows the frequencies users for all combinations each value of each variable. So if there three referral URLs in the data and four browser types, the resulting table would have 12 cells. Again, cross-tabulation is only possible for discrete variables.\n\nThe other reason to distinguish variables into discrete and continuous is so that you can select and/or configure your Machine Learning algorithm in accord with whether your response variable (the one you are trying to predict) is discrete or continuous.\n\nAn orthogonal classification of variable types (again, i'm referring to columns in a data set) is measured versus response (sometimes independent versus dependent). So for instance, you record various session details for each unregistered visitor to your Site,  such as which pages viewed, total pages viewed, total time per page, inbound referral link, outbound link, etc.--those are all measured variables. And one reason to measure these is to predict whether that new user will eventually register and if so will they sign up for the premium service. Those are the response variables. \n\nIn this instance, the response variables might be Registered User and Premium Subscriber and the values for both are either yes or no, which makes this a discrete variable.\n\nWhen your response variable--the thing you are trying to predict--is a factor/discrete variable, you have a classification problem. What's returned by your Machine Learning algorithm is a class label (e.g., registered user or 'not r/u).\n\nIf on the other hand, your response variable is continuous (let's say you wanted to predict expected lifetime value, as total amount wagered, for a new customer on your sports-betting site) then your problem is not classification but regression. In other words, your algorithm must return a value, usually a float.\n\nMany Machine Learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, which you mentioned in your Question (also e.g., Support Vector Machines, and KNN), can be easily configured to run in either mode--classification or regression.\n\nContinuous Variables\n\nContinuous variables are things like time (in seconds), number of login sessions per user,  weight, age, total calories consumed, etc.--things expressed with floats or less often with integers and incremented accordingly (i.e., 1 second more than 56 seconds is 57 seconds). \n\nDealing with these (once you have determined which variables in your data set are in fact continuous) involves usually just the step referred to confusingly as either normalizing, scaling, or standardizing. While they are used interchangeably in practice, they actually refer to separate transformations justified by separate circumstances.\n\nUse or don't use these terms however you wish, though separating the three\nmight help reconcile all of those techniques you see in the literature or that are used in practice.\n\n\nRescaling: for instance, to change the unit of measure; to\nrescale you add/subtract a constant\nthen multiply/divide by another\nconstant. This is easier to show than\ndescribe, e.g., to convert from\nCelsius to Fahrenheit, you add 32 to\nthe Celsius temperature then multiply\nthat value by 9/5;\nNormalizing: dividing by the norm. So for instance, if one of the\nrows in your data set is [1.23, 2.21,\n0.84, 3.54, 1.90], then diving it element-wise by its norm (which is\nabout 4.8 in this case). When you do\nthat, the normalized row you get is\n[0.255, 0.458, 0.174, 0.734, 0.39].\nIf you use Python+NumPy, then the\nexpression is normalized_row1 = row1\n/ LA.norm(row1), with the predicate\nimport statement import numpy.linalg\nas LA');\nStandardizing: refers to a two-step process of subtraction and\ndivision, e.g., to get a variable in\n'standard normal' form, you subtract\nthe mean and divide by the standard\ndeviation, after which your random\nvariable has a mean of 0 and an SD of\n1.\n\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

Then why is this not factored in or considered in the algorithms or programs that books measure time complexity of? CLRS or Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis by Mark Allen Weiss never would add the time complexity of how the arguments are being passed for the total runtime of the program? Am I misunderstanding something? I know CLRS was pseudocode but the Algorithm Analysis by Mark Allen Weiss showed code specific to Java.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nIf I understand your question correctly, you're asking the following:\n\nSome programming languages (most notably, C and C++) make a distinction between passing by value (making a copy of the arguments) and passing by pointer or by reference (in which the arguments aren't copied). The choice of how you pass parameters into a function changes how much work is done by the function, since if you pass by value you need to copy the arguments. However, CLRS doesn't talk about this at all, and books in Java don't address this because they're written in Java. Is this important, and should we care about it?\n\nYou are correct that the mode of parameter passing absolutely makes a difference in how long the function takes to run. For example, here's a not great implementation of binary search written in C++:\n```\n/* Bad code, please don't use this. */\nbool binarySearchFor(std::vector<int> values, int key) {\n    std::size_t lhs = 0, rhs = values.size();\n\n    while (lhs < rhs) {\n        std::size_t mid = lhs + (rhs - lhs) / 2;\n        if (values[mid] == key) return true;\n        else if (values[mid] > key) lhs = mid;\n        else rhs = mid + 1;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThe logic inside this function will run in time O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the ```\nstd::vector```\n. However, since the vector is passed by value, simply copying that vector will take time Θ(n), dwarfing the actual algorithm's runtime and making the whole thing run in time Θ(n). On the other hand, changing the function so that we accept ```\nvalues```\n by ```\nconst```\n reference drops the runtime down to O(log n).\nSo, why doesn't CLRS - or most other algorithms books - talk about this? One of the reasons why is that pass-by-value isn't a feature of all programming languages (or at least, not in the same way that it is in C++). In Python, JavaScript, Java, LISP, etc., parameters are technically passed by value, but since those parameters are references, the cost of passing the parameter is always O(1). So one reason not to talk about this in an algorithms book is that those books talk about the high-level conceptual algorithms followed rather than the actual code to power them, and therefore don't account for all details found in all programming languages. It's expected that you, the Well-Dressed and Wise Reader, will translate their algorithms into your programming language of choice, making appropriate use of the available language features.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

{"Question": "Lexical Analysis - Extraction tokens from DFA constructed directly\r\n                \r\nI've been reading the dragon book and was really interested in the algorithm that converts a regex directly to a DFA (without an explicit NFA). Suppose my lexical file layout is like lex:\n\n```\n...\n%%\nif                       { return IF_TOK;   }\nelse                     { return ELSE_TOK; }\nthen                     { return THEN_TOK; }\n[a-zA-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*     { return IDENT;    }\n...more tokens\n%%\n...\n```\n\n\nI've implemented the algorithm and was wondering how I could extract tokens from it. I know that when an NFA constructed with Thompson's construction (the dragon book's variation), then converted to a DFA, you can get the tokens from the NFA states a DFA is composed of, but I am unsure in this case.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nA (f)lex description -- indeed, any lexical description -- is a collection of regular expressions. However, all practical algorithms match a single regular expression. This isn't a problem because we can simply construct a single regular expression consisting of an alternation between all the possible tokens. So the first four patterns in your example would be combined into\n\n```\n(if|then|else|[a-zA-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)\n```\n\n\nThe direct regex->DFA algorithm given in the Dragon book works on an augmented regular expression, constructed by adding a single end-of-input marker at the end of the regex. States which include the position of this augmented marker are accepting states.\n\nThat's convenient for the description of an algorithm, but not very helpful for the construction of an actual tokeniser, because the tokeniser rarely reaches the end of the input. It just keeps going until no more transitions are possible, at which point it backs up to the last accepting state.\n\nStates in the regex->DFA algorithm correspond to sets of positions in the original regular expression. (If you've written the algorithm you know what a position is, but for the sake of other people reading along, a position is roughly speaking the offset in the regular expression of the character literal (or wildcard character) which has just matched. Not all offsets in the regular expression are positions in this sense; parentheses and operators do not correspond to any matched character, for example. And an entire character class literal is a single position. But it's often easier to think about positions as though they were simply byte offsets in the regular expression itself.)\n\nThat's useful, because we can see instantly from the name of the state where in the regular expression the scan has reached. And since each pattern in the combined regular expression has a different range of positions, we know which rule we're in. If the pattern has succeeded, the rule number tells us which action to choose. If the accepting state is in more than one rule, we just choose the rule with the smallest position, because that's the (f)lex algorithm for selecting between two longest matches of the same length: choose the first one in the scanner definition.\n\nBut, as we noted earlier, the only accepting state is the one corresponding to the end-of-input marker at the end of the augmented pattern, and that is not in any of the original patterns. So if we want to identify the actual pattern, we need to augment each individual rule with its own end marker, rather than having all the rules share a single end marker. Furthermore, the end marker cannot be restricted to just matching the (fictional) character at the end of the input, because we're interested in the longest matching prefix rather than a complete match. So we have to consider the end marker as matching any single character, including the fictional end-of-input character. (That makes it a wilder wildcard than ```\n.```\n, since ```\n.```\n only matches real characters, not fictional end-of-input characters, and also -- in the real (f)lex implementation -- only real characters which happen not to be newline characters. But in principle, it's a kind of wildcard character, except that it doesn't absorb the character it matches.)\n\nSo the end result is that we transform the collection of patters into:\n\n```\n(if#|then#|else#|[a-zA-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*#)\n```\n\n\nwhere ```\n#```\n is the end-of-match wildcard (or, more accurately, zero-length assertion which always succeeds) as described above. Then, every state which includes one (or more) of the ```\n#```\n wildcards is an accepting state. The position it corresponds to is the smallest position in its name which corresponds to a ```\n#```\n, and the rule action which should be taken is the one whose augmented pattern includes that ```\n#```\n.\n    ", "Knowledge_point": "Books and Algorithms", "Tag": "算法分析"}

We spent the semester building a ray tracer and adding features to it. We built everything from scratch in C++, presumably for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the underlying data structures and algorithms. Here's my question: If I were to get a job in industry with computer graphics, would people think I was crazy if I started building everything from the ground up for ray tracing like this? Are there graphics libraries and frameworks similar to OpenGL which support ray tracing? Does OpenGL itself support ray tracing?\n\nMy professor for the course is an expert in the fundamentals of computer graphics theory and the relevant mathematics, but doesn't have any understanding of modern frameworks and libraries which are used by professionals for computer graphics. She's more of a scientist than a practitioner.\n\nIf I were to use a library to help me out with ray tracing, it would probably be good if it supported distributing the computations to a cluster of computers. I could also use a book recommendation, if you know of one which would help bridge this gap in my understanding.\n    ", "Answer": "\r\nAlthough I'm sure there are a number of specialized commercial products, I think overall the most widely used package is the open-source POVRay.
